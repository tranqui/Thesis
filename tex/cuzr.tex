\chapter{Local structure in CuZr metallic glasses}
Molecular dynamics simulations exploring the connection between local structure and dynamics in a model metallic glassformer.
The phenomenology is supported by a mean-field treatment of local structure.

\section{Phenomenology from molecular dynamics simulations}
Using the embedded atom model.
\subsection{Embedded atom model}
\subsection{Role of local structure}
\subsubsection{Importance of the icosahedral motif}
As reported in literature.
\subsubsection{Our simulations}
In molecular dynamics simulations we show icosahedral motif is not as prevalent as previously reported, and correlates poorly with dynamics.
\subsubsection{Role of other structural motifs}
\subsection{Comparison with conventional glassforming liquids}

\section{First principles local structure from a mean field approximation}
