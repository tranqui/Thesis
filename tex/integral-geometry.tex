\section{Integral geometry}
The mathematical formalism which provides elegant and unified description of sizes, underlying the morphological approach taken in the thesis.
Ideas from this branch of mathematics were crucial to the development of fundamental measure theory, so it makes sense to place this before the section
on liquid state theory.
Integral geometry is generally unfamiliar to people from a physics background, so I will attempt to describe this area with additional care.

\subsection{Motivation}

\subsection{Generalised functions acting on sets}
\subsubsection{Set arithmetic}
Minkowski addition and its inverse
\subsubsection{Distances between sets}
The Hausdorff metric.
\subsubsection{Valuations on sets}
Additivity criterion and its significance

\subsection{Important theorems for continuous invariant valuations}
\subsubsection{Principal kinematic formula}
\subsubsection{Steiner formula for parallel surfaces}
\subsubsection{Hadwigerâ€™s characterisation theorem}
