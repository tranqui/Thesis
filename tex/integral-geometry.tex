\subsection{Motivation}

Geometry has been a recurring theme in physical theories, because of its deepness and intuitive nature.
There are many ways that geometric ideas can be incorporated, but our focus will be on expansions of thermodynamic quantities in terms of \emph{sizes}.
This is because extensivity is important to statistical mechanics; the thermodynamic limit requires it.
So by focusing on quantities which are extensive we ensure a thermodynamically consistent treatment.
We will use the familiar notion of \emph{extensivity} within statistical mechanics to guide this discussion.
% illustrate the usefulness of a description in terms of general notions of sizes
Defining an extensive quantity as one that scales proportionally to system size, the first meaning of size that comes to mind is probably the volume.

%The first notion of size that likely comes to mind is the volume, though we will generalise to all reasonable notions of size.
%The simplest example we can give is from statistical mechanics: an \emph{extensive variable} is one that scales proportionally to the system volume.
%For a finite system $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ %the volume is expressed
%% \begin{equation}
%%   V[K] = \int_K d\vec{r}.
%% \end{equation}
%Then,
An extensive variable would be written
\begin{equation*}
  U = u V
\end{equation*}
where $u$ would be an energy density which is intensive, i.e.\ it does not change with system volume.
Extensivity is a fundamental concept within statistical mechanics, so at the very least the volume is an important size measure.
By generalising our notion of `size' beyond volume we hope to arrive at new ideas that prove useful in developing new theories.
We will begin by listing some examples of other possible notions of size.

Firstly, the surface area $A$ is another intuitive notion of size, because.
Secondly, those familiar with differential geometry will have probably encountered the various curvature measures.
In particular, we introduce the integrated mean and Gaussian curvatures $C$ and $X$.
We can \emph{express} these new quantities as the surface integrals
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:intrinsic-volumes-surface-integrals}
  \begin{align}
    A[K]
    &=
    \int_{\partial K} \, d\vec{r},
    \\
    C[K]
    &=
    \frac{1}{2} \int_{\partial K} \Tr{\kappa} \, d\vec{r},
    \\
    X[K]
    &=
    \int_{\partial K} \det{\kappa} \, d\vec{r},
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\kappa$ is the curvature tensor for the surface $\partial K$.
%All of these functionals act on $K$ but the latter three can also be \emph{expressed} as surface integrals, as in
In addition, interfacial properties would be normally expressed in terms of these quantities with common examples including the surface tension conjugating with the area and the Young-Laplace equation, which expresses the pressure difference between two phases to the curvature of its boundary.
Together, the volume, area and the curvature measures are Both of these are popular motifs in statistical mechanics, with the area being important for surface tension corrections to the energy, the interfacial energy involves the surface area; 
%is a powerful tool for incorporating intuitive, flexible ideas into theories.
%For this reason geometric approaches are common in statistical mechanics such as the Young-Laplace equation, which corrects Asakura-Ozawa

Other examples of theories which incorporate notions of size include the Asakura-Ozawa, which describes depletion forces using exclusion volumes, and more generally any free volume theory which expresses an energy in terms of a volume in space.
We introduce the field of \emph{integral geometry} which generalises the underlying geometric principles of these theories into a unified framework for characterising size.
%% We could argue that fundamentally these theories are based on measuring physical sizes.
%% Integral geometry offers a mathematically rigorous formalism for describing sizes, so presents a possible starting point for free volume theories.
This mathematical formalism provides elegant and unified description of sizes, and was crucial in the development of many theories of the liquid state.
The morphological approach taken in the thesis.
%Ideas from this branch of mathematics were crucial to the development of fundamental measure theory (section \ref{sec:fmt}), so it makes sense to place this before the section on liquid state theory.
As integral geometry is generally unfamiliar to people with a background in physics, we will place emphasis on the concepts and intuition rather than rigour.

\subsection{What do we even mean by size?}

First we define our objects: sets in Euclidean space.
We will see that the only reasonable notion of size is a \emph{continuous} rigid-motion invariant valuation.

We could completely describe the size of simple objects by completely defining their geometry, e.g.\ the dimensions of a box.
This is of course sufficient, however it is not very useful.
However, this may not be straightforward for more complex objects, and by abstracting the problem somewhat we can obtain useful theorems etc.
%% We now give a brief justification of the above \emph{ansatzes}, in particular why there are only four terms in the expansion.
%% Radius is the only natural parameter for a sphere, however for more general geometries there might be arbitrarily many parameters so one may wonder if they should be included in a general geometric expansion.

So we have to generalise what we mean by size, simultaneously we will have to carefully specify what objects we wish to measure.
We might naively select all subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, however this leads to pathological problems; the Banach-Tarski paradox ensues.
We need to be precise with what kind of geometries we consider: a definition too broad may not allow meaningful size measures, while a narrow definition may cease to be useful.

We consider polyconvex sets%
\marginfootnote{The set of polyconvex objects is also sometimes called the \emph{convex ring}.}.
Avoid pathological sets: Banach-Tarski paradox allows one to break a sphere apart and recompose it as two identical spheres.
We want a well-defined volume, so need to avoid sets which allow this.
\marginfootnote{Have to be formed by countable union of convex objects.
Covers most physically realistic geometries.}

The first intuitive notion for a size: the size of nothing is zero, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
  \phi(\emptyset) = 0
\end{equation}
where $\emptyset$ is the empty set.
A box: take the largest length, but then the `size' is not increased by modifying its smallest dimensions.
Ideally, we want a size measure that increases monotonically as we add additional material. This leads to additivity:
\begin{equation}
  \phi(A \cup B) = \phi(A) + \phi(B) - \phi(A \cap B)
\end{equation}
Connection with entropy, leads to homogeneity in arguments which is the building block for extensivity of a thermodynamic potential.
This provides a geometrically precise foundation for thermodynamic potentials.

Compactness:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Bounded}: the body must be finite in scope, as no meaningful size can be defined for a body spanning an infinite region of space.
\item \emph{Closed}: the body contains its boundary.
  This is an important property which we will see by example in discussing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem below.
\end{itemize}
The empty set $\emptyset$ is a compact body, albeit a special case with zero size.
Compact convex set $K \in \mathcal{K}$ notation.

\subsection{Euler characteristic}

Aim of this section is to provide intuition over Euler characteristic.

Repeat arguments in figures and you obtain the general rule that dividing an $n$-sphere gives two $n-1$-dimensional convex objects and a $n-1$ sphere dividor.
This gives us the rule for the Euler characteristic.
Euler characteristic describes the topology.

\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple disjoint convex objects: increase
\item Holes lower Euler characteristic
\item Cavities increase
\end{itemize}

For $d=3$ we have the important Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

The only convex object in 1d is a line segment.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=A note on nomenclature]
  The terms `sphere' and `ball' are used interchangeably in physics (and colloquially), however in geometry these refer to different things; `ball' refers to the solid object whereas `sphere' refers to its boundary, i.e.\
  \begin{equation*}
    S^{d-1} = \partial B^d,
  \end{equation*}
  As a surface manifold, the $(d-1)$-dimensionality of the sphere is reduced by one from its original space.
  So strictly speaking, when we speak of hard spheres in physics we really mean hard balls%
  \marginfootnote{Strictly speaking the interactions between hollow spheres and solid balls would be identical, so it is possible to still speak of hard spheres.
    However, typically we always exclude geometries where spheres contain each another so hard balls better capture the interactions of interest.
    Moreover, colloidal hard spheres are solid.}
  in the geometric sense.
\end{tcolorbox}

Should explain intrinsic volumes earlier perhaps.
Euler characteristic of a boundary depends on dimension:
\begin{align}
  \mu_0(K^d) &= 1 \\
  \mu_0(\partial K^d) &= 1 + (-1)^d
\end{align}
Disjoint union: sum them (by inclusion-exclusion principle).

Euler characteristic is the simplest size measure: why is this a size measure?
\marginfootnote{As an illustration of why this is a size measure, I like to imagine that the \emph{size} of a pirate's treasure is the \emph{number} of gold coins in their possession, which is the Euler characteristic of their hoard.}

\begin{theorem}{Gauss-Bonnet theorem}
  Using the additivity property we can decompose the Euler characteristic into a surface and interior term
  \begin{equation*}
    \chi(\partial K) + \chi( \interior(K) ) = \chi(K) = 1
  \end{equation*}
  using the fact that the Euler characteristic of a compact body is unity.
\end{theorem}

The main point of this theorem is that it establishes an equivalence between two seemingly distinct measures of size (? could be equivalence between surface measure and volume one): Gaussian curvature and Euler characteristic.
For a spherical solute these reduce to the values given in \eqref{eq:spt-ansatz}, so this represents a proper generalisation of SPT for more general geometries.

\subsection{Generalisation: intrinsic volumes}

To obtain results for all physical dimensions $d \le 3$ it is convenient to generalise the morphometric \emph{ansatz} \eqref{eq:morphometric-approach} to arbitrary $d$ and substitute $d \in \{1, 2, 3\}$ at the end of our derivation.
To that end it is convenient to introduce generalisations of the geometric parameters $\{V,A,C,X\}$: the \emph{intrinsic volumes} $\{V_d, V_{d-1}, \cdots, V_0\}$.
To introduce the intuition behind these generalised volumes we start from the observation that the quantities $\{V,A,C,X\}$ can be imagined as size descriptors for projections onto $k$-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$; for a compact body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ we have:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V(K)$ is trivially the volume of the intersection of $K$ with the 3-dimensional subspace i.e.\ all of Euclidean space.
\item $A(K)$ can be thought of as the typical size of two-dimensional images formed by projections onto planes.
\item $C(K)$ is related to the projections onto one-dimensional subspaces i.e.\ lines.
  This curvature measure is normally thought of as a surface property, but this definition suggests an equivalence (up to a different normalisation) with the \emph{mean width} $L(K)$ of the body.
\item $X(K)$ is obtained from projections onto a single point; this surface measure is thus equivalent to the Euler characteristic $\chi(K)$.
  This connection results in the celebrated Gauss-Bonnet theorem of differential geometry, which we would write
  \begin{equation*}
    X(K) = 2\pi \chi(K)
  \end{equation*}
  in our notation.
\end{enumerate}

Generalising the above intuition to $d$-dimensions, we see that in general we can imagine $d+1$ projections and so expect $d+1$ corresponding volumes.
We define the $k$th intrisic volume as the average size of the projections onto $k$-dimensional linear subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$, i.e.\
%Denoting the space of all $k$ dimensional linear subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$ as $\mathrm{Graff}(d,k)$ (the affine Grassmanian), the intrinsic volume is obtained by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intrinsic-volumes}
  V_k(K)
  =
  C_{k,d-k}
  \int \chi(K \cap E_{d-k}) \, d\mu(E_{d-k})
\end{equation}
where the integral is taken over all affine transformations of the plane $E_k$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and the flag coefficient is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:flag-coefficients}
  C_{k,d-k}
  :=
  \frac{d!}{k! (d-k)!} \frac{\omega_d}{\omega_k \omega_{d-k}},
\end{equation}
where the volume of the $d$-dimensional unit ball is
\begin{equation}
  \omega_d := V_d(B^d) = \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2} + 1)}.
\end{equation}
The flag coefficients $C_{k,d-k}$ have a similar structure to binomial coefficients, and play a similar \emph{combinatorial} role for combining subspaces (section \ref{sec:kinematic-formula}).
By convention, the normalisation of the measure $d\mu(E_{d-k})$ in \eqref{eq:intrinsic-volumes} is chosen to give the intrinsic volumes for the $d$-dimensional unit ball $B^d$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intrinsic-volume-ball}
  V_k (B^d)
  =
  {d \choose k} \frac{\omega_d}{\omega_{d-k}}.
\end{equation}
%The intrinsic volumes thus only depend on the dimensionality of the body, not the embedding space.
A set of common geometrical quantities and their reduction to the intrinsic volumes in physical dimensions $d \le 3$ is given in Table~\ref{table:geometric-quantities}.
Finally, with the intrinsic volumes the generalisation of the morphometric apparoach \eqref{eq:morphometric-approach} for a solute $K$ in $d$-dimensions reads
\begin{equation}\label{eq:morphometric-approach-d}
  \Delta \Omega(K)
  =
  \sum_{k=0}^d a_k V_k(K).
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}{Hadwiger's characterisation theorem}
  Together the functionals $\{\mu_k\}_{k=0}^d$ form a basis for the vector space of all continuous rigid-motion invariant valuations on polyconvex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
I.e. a continuous rigid-motion invariant valuation can be written
\begin{equation}
  \mu(A) = \sum_{i=0}^d c_i \mu_i(A)
\end{equation}
where $c_i$ are some coefficients independent of $A$.
\end{theorem}

The basis of the morphometric approach is that the functionals $\{V,A,C,X\}$ are normalisations of the so-called \emph{intrinsic volumes}.
These play a central role in integral geometry as the \emph{only} physically meaningful size measures in the sense that they:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Are invariant with respect to translations and rotations.
\item Increase additively, i.e.\ they transform under combination of subsystems via the inclusion/exclusion relation e.g.\
  \begin{equation*}\label{eq:additivity}
    V[A \cup B] = V[A] + V[B] - V[A \cap B],
  \end{equation*}
  and similar expressions for $A$, $C$, and $X$.
\item Are continuous (specifically with respect to the Hausdorff metric).
  Loosely speaking, this means that the size measures converge as the object is approximated by increasingly finely meshed polyhedra excluding e.g.\ fractal geometries.
  As a simple intuitive example, the measurement of a length will converge continuously to some number as one uses rulers with progressively finer distance markings.
\end{enumerate}
More details on properties of intrinsic volumes can be found in standard texts, e.g.\ Refs.\ \cite{Santalo2004,Klain1997}.
%\cite{Santalo2004,SchneiderACIG1984,Schneider2008,Klain1997}.

The central assertion of the morphometric approach is that the insertion cost $\Delta \Omega$ \emph{exactly} possesses the properties above, providing the connection between geometry and thermodynamics \cite{KonigPRL2004}.
A classic theorem of integral geometry due to Hadwiger \cite{Hadwiger1957} states that the intrinsic volumes are the \emph{only} class of functionals with the properties listed above; a corollary of this is that they form a linear vector space for any functional possessing these properties.
The morphometric form \eqref{eq:morph-ansatz} then follows.
In addition to providing a more general \emph{ansatz} than SPT, this approach lays out its underlying assumptions explicitly eschewing the ad-hoc way in which the original SPT \emph{ansatz} \eqref{eq:spt-ansatz} was obtained.

The morphometric approach is certainly an approximation, as the insertion cost will not rigorously possess the three properties above in reality.
Notably, in SPT $\Delta\Omega$ is known to contain singularities in its high order derivatives with solute radius \cite{ReissJCP1959}; these non-analytic terms result from violations of the additivity assumption.
Nevertheless, the approximation is accurate in hard spheres \cite{OettelEL2009,AshtonPRE2011,LairdPRE2012,BlokhuisPRE2013,UrrutiaPRE2014,Hansen-GoosJCP2014} so these violations should be small.

    However, the intrinsic volumes are more general as they can be evaluated for shapes where curvatures are not locally defined, e.g. at lines and vertices.}

\subsection{Kinematic formulae}

Motivate: usefulness in evaluating partition functions.
Probability of particles `hitting' one another.
Develop notation.

It is usual for liquid state theories to focus on spherically symmetric potentials, however integral geometry more naturally deals with non-spherical objects so we can consider this generalisation at the small cost of additional notation.
In addition to integrations over particle positions $\{\vec{r}_1, \cdots, \vec{r}_n\}$ we also have to consider their orientations $\{\vec{\theta}_1, \cdots, \vec{\theta}_n\}$ where each $\vec{\theta}_i$ represents an Euler angle tuple.
Then, assuming an isotropic phase where all orientations are equally likely each positional integral generalises to
\begin{equation*}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} d\vec{r}
  \to
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^d \times SO(d)} d\vec{r} d\vec{\theta}
  :=
  \int_{G_d} dg,
\end{equation*}
with the normalisation in the angular measure such that $\int d\vec{\theta} = 1$. In the right-most equality we introduced the rigid motion operation acting on a body $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ as
\begin{equation*}
  g A := \{\mathcal{R}(\vec{\theta}) \vec{a} + \vec{r} \, | \, \vec{a} \in A\},
  %(\mathcal{T} \circ \mathcal{R})(\vec{r}, \vec{\theta}),
\end{equation*}
a member of the rigid motion group $g \in G_d := \mathbb{R}^d \times SO(d)$, and where $\mathcal{R} \in SO(d)$ is the rotation matrix parameterised by $\vec{\theta}$.
We can take standard results for simple liquids interacting via spherically symmetric pair potentials, and make the above replacement to obtain the correct generalisation for arbitrary shapes.

\begin{theorem}{Principal kinematic formula}
  Noting that $\chi = V_0$ is the lowest order intrinsic volume, the latter line of \eqref{eq:low-density-insertion} is ideally suited to a treatment within integral geometry.
  A central result of this field is the principal kinematic formula of Blaschke and Santal\'o \cite{BlaschkeMZ1936,Blaschke1937,SantaloASI1936} which gives the explicit form of integrals of this type as \cite{Santalo2004,Klain1997}
  %\cite{Santalo2004,SchneiderACIG1984,Schneider2008,Klain1997}
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:binomial-kinematic-formula}
    \int_{G_d} \chi(A \cap gB) \, dg
    =
    \sum_{k=0}^d (C_{k,d-k})^{-1} V_k(A) V_{d-k}(B)
  \end{equation}
  We see the flag coefficients \eqref{eq:flag-coefficients} play an analogous role in conjugating the intrinsic volumes above as binomial coefficients do in algebraic expansions%
  \marginfootnote{For this reason Klain and Rota argue that integral geometry should be called \emph{continuous combinatorics} \cite{Klain1997}, because it generalises combinatorial results to continuous spaces}.
  More general formulas exist for integrals over other intersection intrinsic volumes \cite{Klain1997}, however these do not have an interpretation in terms of evaluating partition functions so we will not use them.
\end{theorem}

The principal kinematic formula \eqref{eq:binomial-kinematic-formula} can be iterated for the intersections of many bodies $\{K_i\}$ giving \cite{Santalo2004,MarechalPRE2014}
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:multinomial-kinematic-formula}
  \begin{equation}
    \Lambda_{s_1, \cdots, s_n}
    =
      \sum_{\substack{i_0, \cdots, i_n = 0 \\ i_0 + \cdots + i_n = nd}}^d
      (C_{i_0, \cdots, i_n})^{-1}
      V_{i_0}(K_0)
      \prod_{j=1}^n
      \widetilde{V}_{i_j}(K_{s_j})
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \textrm{with} \qquad
    C_{i_0, \cdots, i_n}
    := \frac{1}{i_0! \omega_{i_0}}
    \prod_{j=1}^n
    \left(
    \frac{d!}{i_j!} \frac{\omega_d}{\omega_{i_j}}
    \right)
  \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where $C_{i_0, \cdots, i_n}$ would be the multinomial generalisation of the flag coefficients \eqref{eq:flag-coefficients}.
We will use this iterated formula in chapter \ref{chapter:resummation} to resum a piece of the virial series (introduced in section \ref{sec:virial-series}).

%%   \begin{equation}
%%     \int_{\mathbb{E}_d} \mu_k (A \cap g B) \, dg =
%%     \sum_{i=0}^{d-k}
%%     {i + k \brack k} {d \brack i}^{-1}
%%     \mu_{i+k}(A) \mu_{d-i}(B)
%%   \end{equation}
%%   \begin{equation*}
%%     \int_{\mathbb{E}_d} \mu_k (A \cap g B) \, dg =
%%     \sum_{i=0}^{d-k}
%%     {i + k \brack k}
%%     {d \brack i + k}
%%     \kappa_{i+k}(A) \kappa_{d-i}(B)
%%   \end{equation*}
%%   In regular binomial:
%%   \begin{equation*}
%%     \int_{\mathbb{E}_d} \mu_k (A \cap g B) \, dg =
%%     \sum_{i=0}^{d-k}
%%     {i + k \choose k} {d \choose i}^{-1}
%%     \frac{\omega_{i+k} \omega_{d-i}}{\omega_k \omega_d}
%%     \mu_{i+k}(A) \mu_{d-i}(B)
%%   \end{equation*}
%% \end{theorem}

%% \begin{equation*}
%%   {n \choose k} {k \choose p}
%%   =
%%   \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
%%   \frac{k!}{p!(k-p)!}
%%   =
%%   \frac{n!}{p!(k-p)!(n-k)!}
%%   =
%%   {n \choose p, k-p, n-k}
%% \end{equation*}
%% I.e. this is a trinomial coefficient.
%% So we have
%% \begin{equation*}
%%   {n \brack k} {k \brack p}
%%   =
%%   {n \choose k}
%%   {k \choose p}
%%   \frac{\omega_n}{\omega_k \omega_{n-k}}
%%   \frac{\omega_k}{\omega_p \omega_{k-p}}
%%   =
%%   {n \choose p, k-p, n-k}
%%   \frac{\omega_n}{\omega_p \omega_{k-p} \omega_{n-k}}
%% \end{equation*}
