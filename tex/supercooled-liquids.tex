%% \subsection{Old intro stuff}

%% It is widely reported that glass is actually liquid, and as evidence of this the thickness of old windows at the bottom is pointed to.
%% This is actually a matter of some dispute, but contains a grain of truth.
%% Pre-modern methods of creating window glass involved spinning molten glass on magma to flatten it out.
%% Centrifugal forces caused the glass to be thicker on the outer disc, so panes of glass would always be heavier in one direction%
%% \marginfootnote{And personally, if I were setting an uneven pane of glass I would place the thicker and heavier part at the bottom.}.

%% To a soft matter physicist glass is a broader term, referring to a wide class of materials while the window glass of common parlance is referred to by its chemical name \emph{silicate}.
%% This class of materials share many features of being disordered etc \cite{?} although in some sense they are connected by what they do \emph{not} do: which is flow on human timescales.
%% When I refer to `glass' I will be using it in this broad technical sense of a state of matter.
%% Some examples besides silicate:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Most of the ice in the universe exists in an amorphous state in comets \cite{?}
%% \item Ceramics
%% \item Plastics: amorphous polymers
%% \end{itemize}
%% Of more abstract nature which could be called glassy though they are not materials
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Gels: super glasses, liquid like bit plus a network/backbone which has glassy dynamics
%% \item Neural networks
%% \item Non-deterministic polynomial time (NP) problems
%% \end{itemize}
%% We will not be directly addressing the latter type of more abstract problems which could be considered glasses, although they are arguably related due to a similar underlying disorder.
%% We will be focusing on only the most rudimentary of glassy phenomenology: the dynamical arrest of liquids at high densities/low temperatures when crystallisation is avoided.
%% Especially as it manifests in hard spheres, which as discussed is the reference system of choice for simple liquids.

%% Personally, the observation that got me interested in the field is the entropy argument.
%% If one compares the difference between the entropy of the crystal and the glass, and extrapolates wildly one expects there to be a point where the glass has a lower entropy than the crystal.
%% This is not very meaningful by itself, as we have already established by discussing the crystal vibrational entropy can be quite subtle so it is possible for the liquid to have a lower vibrational entropy.
%% However, if one corrects this with more modern techniques to measure just the entropy corresponding to non-trivial motion we see that there is a point where the configurational (i.e.\ not purely vibrational) entropy vanishes: this would imply the system is frozen in a single configuration.
%% Such a point would define a transition to a genuine thermodynamic phase, an ideal glass.

%% What is a glass?
%% Frozen in a (apparently) disordered state.
%% All sorts of glasses, structural, spin, orientational, electron, vortex.
%% Glasses formed by liquids, colloidal suspensions and polymers: traditional structural glasses.
%% Solid: doesn't flow on observational time, resists small/infinitesimal shear (acts like solid).
%% Amorphous, apparently amorphous: no periodic arrangement like in crystal.
%% Homogeneous makes useful for technology: useful for e.g.\ optical properties.

In the introduction we established the supercooled liquid in hard spheres as the extension of the stable liquid above the freezing density, where it is metastable to the crystal phase.
To provide proper context we will discuss supercooled liquids more generally here, including thermal systems where temperature is the more natural control parameter.
As such, we will be considering the effect of decreasing temperature on the supercooled liquid.

\subsection{Properties of the supercooled liquid}

We will start by exploring the ways in which supercooled liquids are the \emph{same} as regular liquids, expanding in more detail on ideas discussed in the introduction.
Then we will move onto the ways in which they \emph{differ} from ordinary liquids, notably in their dynamical properties.

\begin{SCfigure}
  \missingfigure[figwidth=\linewidth]{$g^{(2)}$}%
  \caption{Minimum change in pairwise structure with increasing density above the melting point, as measured by the pair distribution function \eqref{eq:n-particle-distribution}.}
  \label{fig:g2-changes}
\end{SCfigure}

Structurally, supercooled liquids are not meaningfully different from their ordinary counterparts.
Operationally, a supercooled liqiud is equilibrated in the sense that all observables are time independent and the thermodynamics is self-consistent%
\marginfootnote{Different routes to measuring thermodynamic quantities, e.g.\ the pressure, may give different values in an out-of-equilibrium system.
  This is not the case in supercooled liquids, even though they are not strictly in equilibrium.}.
Formally speaking, the system is sometimes said to be in \emph{local equilibrium}, where it samples all the liquid microstates ergodically; or that it obeys \emph{detailed balance}, where the dynamics is microscopically reversible.
%have very similar structural characteristics as at equilibrium.
As a consequence, the liquid loses any memory of its preparation and all observables become time independent.
That is, for some observable $A$ we can write
\begin{equation*}
  \langle A(t) \rangle = \langle A \rangle
\end{equation*}
As an example, the pair distribution function $g^{(2)}(r)$ is seen to change very little in hard spheres as the density is increased (Fig.\ \ref{fig:g2-changes}).
As pair correlations are the main measure of structure in simple liquids, this suggests minimal structural change undergone by the high density liquid.
Second, time correlation functions become independent e.g.\
\begin{equation*}
  \langle A(t) A(t') \rangle = \langle A(0) A(t - t') \rangle
\end{equation*}

A more sophisticated examination of the equilibrium involves the response functions.
In an equilibrium system, the response of a system to a small perturbation is directly related to the microscopic source of fluctuations%
\marginfootnote{Temperature, in the case of liquids.}.
The fluctuation-dissipation relation for an observable $A$ expresses the system's susceptibility to perturbation as
\begin{equation*}
  \chi_A (t, t')
  =
  - \beta \Theta(t - t')
  \frac{d}{dt}
  \left(
  \bigg\langle
  (A(t - t') - \langle A \rangle)
  (A(0) - \langle A \rangle)
  \bigg\rangle
  \right)
\end{equation*}
where the Heaviside theta function imposes causality.
\todo{Check this against textbook}

Both of these conditions are violated in the glass, as this is a truly non-equilibrium state.
That is, we see ageing, and hysteresis in response to perturbations.

\begin{SCfigure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth,center]{transition-state}
  \caption[Transition state theory]{

  }
\end{SCfigure}

Now we turn to discussing the ways in which supercooled liquids are markedly different from their ordinary counterparts: in their \emph{dynamics}.
\todo{Repetition of `ordinary counterparts'}
A helpful framework to guide discussion of dynamical processes is \emph{transition state theory}.
In this approach a dynamical process, e.g.\ a chemical reaction, is imagined to occur through a dynamical bottleneck (Fig.\ \ref{?}).
We imagine evaluating a thermodynamic potential%
\marginfootnote{Which thermodynamic potential this corresponds to will depend on the ensemble.}
$\Phi$ at every point along the reaction path.
The process will then be limited by the rate of thermal fluctuations of size $\Delta \Phi$, i.e.\ those able to reach the transition state.
In equilibrium, the timescale for the process will then scale by the Boltzmann weight
\begin{equation}
  \tau \sim e^{\beta \Delta \Phi}.
\end{equation}
This approach can be given more rigorous justification through e.g.\ an \emph{instanton} approach \cite{LangerAP1969}.
The main limitation of this approach is the assumption that the dynamical process occurs through an effectively one-dimensional reaction path; later, we will introduce a more sophisticated form of this framework which considers the high dimensional \emph{energy landscape}.

We discussed the static correlation functions at length, which is fine for liquids where equilibrium occurs on a \SI{100}{\pico\second} timescale.
Dynamical effects are highly nontrivial at high densities.

To look at dynamics we could equivalently consider viscosity or relaxation time.
We will discuss nucleation theory in chapter \ref{chapter:aerosols}, but briefly we expect:
\begin{equation*}
  \tau_x \sim \exp{ \beta \Delta}
\end{equation*}

We will talk about this metastable branch as if it were in equilibrium.

Overview of the glass transition.
Salient features: why hard, interesting, unique.

Hard glasses: high elastic constants.
Colloidal suspensions: soft matter version, small elastic constants.
Same phenomenology though.

Cooling a liquid.
Take thermodynamic quantity (e.g.\ volume, entropy, enthalpy): usually crystallise.
(Picture)
First-order transition bypassed by quick cooling.
Enter supercooled liquid phase.
No longer equilibrates/relax/flows, call it a glass: occurs at glass transition.
Glass is a solid for all practical purposes.

Distinguished from glass which has dependence on preparation history, hysteresis/memory effect of heating the system (will not follow exactly the same curve until - back to the equilibrium supercooled structure), aging: averages (including correlations) evolve in time.

The glass transition itself is not a ``transition'' in the thermodynamic sense; there is no.
It's really a kind of impatience transition; the glass transition for a human would be different to the glass transition for a demigod/ent.
It's still a relatively robust measurement, because of the superarrhenius scaling (sc-l for pedestrians).

No glass from noble gases; too high propensity for first order transition.

Below melting, the crystal is the state lowest in free energy so strictly metastable.
Though not strictly an equilibrium state, we can think about it as such.
Hard spheres have particular propensity to crystallise at very high densities, so typically polydispersity is introduced to frustrate crystals favouring amorphous structures.

A plethora of questions related to the out-of-equilibrium properties.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Properties of out of equilibrium glass phase: very important questions for material science. Low temperature anomalies, aging behaviour, nonlinear rheology  plasticity.
\item Relation between glass and jamming. Jamming=zero temperature, out of equilibrium, infinite pressure.
\item How to avoid crystallisation.
\end{enumerate}

Understand prpoerties of the supercooled liquid, that distinguish it from ordinary liquids (dynamically).
What properties distinguish the supercooled liquid from the regular liquid:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Stokes-Einstein breakdown
\item Dynamical heterogeneities
\end{enumerate}

So what do we mean by dynamical arrest.
Typically we can look at one of two (related) quantities: viscosity or relaxation time.
Viscosity measures how resistant the thing is to flow, while relaxation time measures the typical microscopic time for things to move around i.e.\ liquid like behaviour.
As a practical definition, a glass is defined in the lab as any material for which the relaxation time exceeds 100\ce{s}: this point is called the experimental glass transition.
This is somewhat arbitrary, although the location of the glass transition point is not particularly sensitive to where you set the threshold because of how rapidly the viscosity/times are increasing around there.

Remarkable dynamic range: observed change over 16 orders of magnitude.
Arrhenius plot.
Experiments: dynamic light scattering.
\begin{equation}
  \langle \delta A(0) \delta A(t) \rangle
  \to \tau_{relax}
\end{equation}
Decay of function gives timescale.
Angell plot (1984?): rescale by Tg and classify different systems.
Strong: Arrhenius, fragile: super-arrhenius (this naming system is odd: it has nothing to do with their mechanical properties)

Assume single fundamental process in relaxation: e.g.\ breaking a chemical bond.
Then barrier constant leads to Arrhenius law.
\begin{equation}
  \tau \sim \tau_0 e^{\frac{\Delta U}{T}}
\end{equation}
(could be free energy)
Interactions in soft matter are typically van der Waals, very weak, so to build large activation energy lots of particles must be contributing.
Super Arrhenius behaviour must arise from collective behaviour.
Collective behaviour: many-body effects requires many-body correlations.

Some systems are Arrhenius: particularly in hard matter systems where interactions are stronger.
E.g.\ Silicate: covalent bonds, so barrier is that required to break a bond.

Phenomenological formula...

Relationship with viscosity.
Flowing/not flowing is captured by viscosity: viscous slowdown same as relaxation slowdown.
Slightly different notion.
Short times $t \ll \tau$: elastic system, long times $t \gg \tau$: viscosity.
Time barrier is relaxation time.
Elasticity, viscosity in Newtonian fluids: viscoelastic behaviour (Maxwell)
\begin{equation}
  \eta = G_\infty \tau_\mathrm{relax}
\end{equation}
high frequency shear modulus is elastic property.
Shear modulus increases by factor 2-5 times, is dwarfed by change in relaxation time.

No crystal: eutectic polymers

In conventional condensed matter physics dynamics is determined by structure.
For example, crystalline solids are fixed on a lattice so do not flow, whereas liquids are disordered and are thus able to flow.
Soft matter systems (e.g.\ gels, foams, glasses) do not neatly fall into this paradigm: their dynamics are often arrested whilst their structure remains highly disordered.

To illustrate the disentanglement between structure and dynamics we will take glasses as an example, because this will be the focus of our work.
A glass is obtained by supercooling a liquid causing its viscosity to increase dramatically.
Viscosity is equivalently measured by a timescale $\tau_\alpha$ for spatial correlations to decay.
This relaxation event should occur against some energy barrier $\Delta$, leading to the scaling relation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:angell}
  \tau_\alpha = \tau_0 \exp{\left(\frac{\Delta}{k_B T}\right)}
\end{equation}
for Boltzmann factor $k_B$, temperature $T$ and where $\tau_0$ is the timescale of vibrations (typically $\tau_0 \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ps for atomic systems).
When $\tau_\alpha$ exceeds an experimentalist's patience (defined as 100s at temperature $T_g$ in the literature), it becomes impossible to properly equilibrate the liquid and we call it a glass.
On accessible timescales the glass will appear (macroscopically) solid, developing a bulk shear modulus etc, yet microscopically it remains disordered like a liquid. 

Naively we might expect $\Delta$ in \eqref{eq:angell} to be temperature independent, suggesting the \emph{Arrhenius} law:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:arrhenius}
  \log{\tau_\alpha} \propto 1/T.
\end{equation}
This works well for high temperature liquids but \emph{can} break down at low temperatures suggesting qualitatively new physics for supercooled liquids.
This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:angell} where $\log{\tau_\alpha}$ is plotted against $1/T$ for selected molecular and model glassformers.
Silica is seen to increase according to \eqref{eq:arrhenius} even at low temperature; this is an example of a \emph{strong} glass which we are not interested in because the underlying physics is essentially that of a slow liquid.
We are instead interested in the deviations from \eqref{eq:arrhenius} displayed by the other systems shown in Figure~\ref{fig:angell}.
These so-called \emph{fragile} glassformers feature more dramatic increase in relaxation times than predicted by \eqref{eq:arrhenius}, meaning $\Delta$ itself increases with supercooling.
This work involves detailed microscopic calculation of energy landscapes in model glassformers, with the intent of determining the cause of increasing relaxation barriers in supercooled liquids.

Some modification is required for hard particle systems.
As we argued in the introduction, pressure is the only meaningful state variable so it is typically used as the equivalent of temperature.
In Ref.\ \cite{BerthierPRE2009} it was argued by analogy to play the role of inverse teperature.
Relaxation barriers in hard spheres are \emph{entropic} in nature, and display the same phenomenology as temperature driven fragile glassformers as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:angell} where a compressibility factor is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  Z = \frac{\beta p}{\rho}
\end{equation*}
where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid. This variable plays the role of $1/T$ for athermal systems, although this analogy is only approximate.
Hard spheres highly fragile: more collective effects.
Easier to see that collective effects: activation barriers must be strictly entropic, which is perhaps easier to argue for collective effects.

\subsection{Mode-coupling theory}

We start with an explicitly dynamical theory.

To motivate mode-coupling theory we start from the classical Langevin equation of motion, which expresses the equations of motion of a subset of the degrees of freedom.
Newton's equation becomes
\begin{equation}
  m \ddot{\vec{r}} = - \lambda \dot{\vec{r}} + \vec{F}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{F}$ is a Gaussian random field
\begin{equation*}
  \langle F_i(t) F_j(t') \rangle = 2 D \delta_{i,j} \delta(t - t').
\end{equation*}
This equation is valid where there is a timescale separation between \emph{slow} and \emph{fast} variables: the position $\vec{r}$ represents a slowly evolving variable of interest, whereas the remaining degrees of freedom (e.g.\ small solvent particles) are imagined to equilibrate rapidly leaving only the force field $\vec{F}$.

In mode-coupling theory, an \emph{exact} generalised Langevin equation is derived as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d \vec{x}(t)}{dt}
  =
  i \vec{\Omega} \cdot \vec{x}
  - \int_0^t \vec{K} \cdot \vec{x}(t - t') \, dt'
  + \vec{f}(t)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{Omega}$ is , $\vec{K}$ is a time-dependent \emph{memory function}, and $\vec{f}$ is the fast fluctuating force.

\cite{ReichmanJSM2005, JanssenFP2018}

The full MCT equation
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^2 F(k,t)}{d t^2}
  + \frac{k^2}{\beta m S(k)} F(k, t)
  + \int_0^t K_\mathrm{MCT}(k, t') \frac{d F(k, t - t')}{dt} \, dt'
  =
  0
\end{equation}
with the memory function given by
\begin{equation}
  K_\mathrm{MCT}
  =
  \frac{\rho}{16 \pi^3 \beta m}
  \int |V_{\vec{q},\vec{k}-\vec{q}}|^2
  F(q, t) F(|\vec{k} - \vec{q}|, t)
  \, d\vec{q}.
\end{equation}

Predicts a diverging timescale.
Nevertheless, liquids can be prepared above this volume fraction in colloidal experiments \cite{BrambillaPRL2009} and simulations \cite{BerthierPRL2016}.

The point of this section is to indicate that pair correlation functions are not enough.

\subsection{Mean-field theory}

A growing consensus is forming around this explanation.

This must trivially occur at the very least $T=0\si{K}$ where relaxation timescales diverges, however much like the lack of a phase transition in the Ising model in $d=1$ this is not a true thermodynamic phase transition because it cannot be crossed.
Recent numerical evidence suggests that a model glassformer in $d=2$ does not show a transition, also vanishing at $T=0\si{K}$ \cite{Berthier?}.
So the central question of glass is what happens in $d=3$, is there a vanishing configurational entropy at a finite $T > 0$ with an accompanying thermodynamic glass transition?
In mean-field, formally in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions $d \to \infty$, the hard sphere system has been shown to have a true transition, however the critical dimensions are unknown so it is unclear what happens in $d=3$. \cite{KurchanJSM2012,KurchanJPCB2013,CharbonneauNC2014,CharbonneauJSM2014}.

Connection between thermodynamics and dynamics.
Configurational entropy.

Inspired by the solutions of mean-field spin glasses, the great breakthrough of the original papers was that these systems were identical in the structure of the energy landscape.

The relevance of mean-field theory in physical dimensions comes from an interpretation \cite{KirkpatrickPRB1987, KirkpatrickPRA1989}, and antecedent ideas found in \cite{AdamJCP1965}.

Patter of Ref.\ \cite{BouchaudJCP2004}.

Point-to-set length is the minimum size of a subsystem for there to be relaxation: the space of states transitions from being a single state (point) to a multitude of states (set).
It can be rigorously proven that a diverging timescale necessarily must coincide with a diverging point-to-set length: Montanari \cite{MontanariJSP2006}.
The essence of the argument is that for a finite subsystem, there will be a finite barrier, so any dynamics must scale Arrheniusly.
Therefore, the relaxation time will be bounded from above by the dynamical lengthscale, and super-Arrhenius scaling suggests growing collective behaviour.

This argument is thermodynamic, which in some sense is structural.
Structural in the sense of the energy landscape, not necessarily in real space/local structure.

    The various methods used (described in Ref.\ \cite{BerthierPNAS2017}) all broadly agree that this quantity is trending to zero at a finite pressure, suggesting the existence of a thermodynamic glass transition.

\subsection{Perspective: role of many-body correlations}

Local mechanisms in the various theories.

\hl{Derivatives of free energy reduce} to $g^{(2)}$,\hl{ emblematic of the conventional routes.
Absolute free energies require higher order correlation functions to appear.}
\todo{Talk about this. Also: entropy route.}

To motivate the use of many-body correlations we employ an argument due to Evans \cite{EvansPrivate2019}.
In section ? we saw the compressibility and virial routes lead to the expression of the free energy in terms of the pair correlation function.
In this sense one may think that all of the information is contained in the two body correlation function.
The pair correlation is used to obtain thermodynamic quantities which are derivatives of the free energy at an instantaneous state point, so to infer the free energy we must sample multiple state points.
Equivalently, we could consider the derivatives of the pair correlation function.
It can be shown in general that \cite{Santos2016}
\begin{equation}
  \chi_T \rho
  \left( \frac{\partial \rho^{(n)}}{\partial \rho} \right)_{V,T}
  =
  (n - \rho V) \rho^{(n)}(\vec{r}^n)
  + \int \rho^{(n+1)}(\vec{r}^{n+1}) \, d\vec{r}_{n+1}.
\end{equation}
The important feature to take away from this is the presence of $\rho^{(n+1)}$ in the expression; higher order correlations emerge in the derivatives.
This means we could in principle measure the free energy at a single state point by introducing highly accurate measurements of the many-body correlation functions.
This is essentially the spirit of the \emph{entropy route}, which writes \cite{WallaceJCP1987}
\begin{equation}
  S = \sum_{n=1}^\infty S_n
\end{equation}
with entropic terms $S_n$ containing contributions from $n$-particle correlations.
The first few terms are given by
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    S_1
    &=
    \\
    S_2
    &=
    \\
    S_3
    &=
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Second, while it is true that thermodynamic quantities like the pressure can certainly be inferred from the pair correlations, there is no such simple relationship for dynamic quantities.
In the absence of a thermodynamic phase transition we would not expect the pair correlation to reveal much about the nature of dynamical arrest (beyond the lack of transition).
And supposing the required precision to detect a signal $g(r)$ may be arbitrarily complicated.
However, the signature of the phase transtion could be weak; we could amplify the signals by looking at the higher order functions.
And any precursors to a transition may become more apparent.

Fourier space vs real space.
We will be focusing on many-body correlations in real space, in line with the theories of the glass transition mentioned above.
It is possible for many-body correlation functions to be useful in MCT where it has already found traction \cite{JanssenPRL2015,JanssenFP2018}.
Although there correlation functions in Fourier space are more useful.

FMT already provides an easy route to obtaining correlation functions in Fourier space, as was demonstrated in the original papers \cite{RosenfeldPRL1989,RosenfeldJCP1990} and we will summarise below.
Applying the convolution theorem to the Fourier transform of the direct correlation function in the uniform liquid \eqref{eq:fmt-direct-correlations-uniform-density} to be written rather succinctly as
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{c}^{(n)}(\vec{k}^n)
  =
  - \sum_{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_n}
  \partial^n_{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_n} \beta f^\mathrm{ex} \;
  \left( \prod_{i=1}^n \widetilde{\omega}_{\alpha_i}(\vec{k}_i) \right)
  \delta(\vec{k}_1 + \vec{k}_2 + \cdots + \vec{k}_n).
\end{equation}
The delta function enforces the `ring' condition $\sum_{i=1}^n \vec{k}_i = 0$ which emerges from translational symmetry of the weight functions, reducing the dimensionality of the domain by $d$.
A further $d(d-1)/2$ degrees of freedom%
\marginfootnote{This many degrees of freedom can be removed for general $n \ge d$, but we expect fewer for $n < d$.
  For example, $n=2$ arrangements (a dimer) are isomorphic to a line so they possess $d-1$ rotational degrees of freedom.}
can be removed by exploiting rotational symmetry.
