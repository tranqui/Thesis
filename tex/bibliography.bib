  abstract = {Hard-sphere molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results, with six-figure accuracy in the thermodynamic equilibrium pressure, are reported and used to test a closed-virial equation-of-state. This latest equation, with no adjustable parameters except known virial coefficients, is comparable in accuracy both to Pad{\'e} approximants, and to numerical parameterizations of MD data. There is no evidence of nonconvergence at stable fluid densities. The virial pressure begins to deviate significantly from the thermodynamic fluid pressure at or near the freezing density, suggesting that the passage from stable fluid to metastable fluid is associated with a higher-order phase transition; an observation consistent with some previous experimental results. Revised parameters for the crystal equation-of-state [R. J. Speedy, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 10, 4387 (1998)] are also reported.},

Here we first give a general scaled-particle method for convex bodies in terms of the characteristic geometrical measures of the depletion agent, i.e., its volume, surface area, and integrated mean curvature, in mixtures with hard spheres. Second, we show that similar results can be derived from fundamental-measure theory. This different approach allows us to get a deep insight into the meaning of the various contributions to the theory from a geometrical point of view. From these two methods we arrive at a generalized "recipe" to free-volume theory. This recipe can be based on a desired equation of state for any convex shape of the depletion agents and is also valid for (polydisperse) mixtures of those. This is illustrated by mixtures of spheres with ellipsoids, spheres with several geometries as models for disklike mesogens, e.g., gibbsite, as well as depletion of spheres due to bar-shaped colloids, e.g., goethite.},

  abstract = {A critical review of the existing literature on the pressure exerted by growing crystals in porous materials reveals that a number of different equations are in use. A derivation of an equation for the crystallization pressure based on the chemical potentials of the loaded and the unloaded faces of a growing crystal is provided. The equation obtained is compared to other equations available in the literature and the different approaches are discussed in detail. The treatment also includes the non-ideal behavior of the liquid phase using the ion interaction approach (Pitzer equations) which is well-established in solution thermodynamics. Incorporating the ion interaction equations in the crystallization pressure equation yields a quite simple expression that appears to be more convenient than previous treatments. The equation is applied to calculate crystallization pressures for supersaturated solutions of aqueous NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4, and MgSO4 including the various hydrated forms of these salts. Depending on the nature of the salt, neglecting the non-ideal behavior may cause considerable error in crystallization pressure calculations. Finally, it is emphasized that the basic assumption of non-uniform pressure is fundamental to understand the dynamics of crystallization pressure evolving in porous materials.},

Rosenfeld's density functional theory (DFT) is applied to determine the density profile and surface tension gamma for wide ranges of radii of the curved walls and densities of the hard-sphere fluid. Particular attention is paid to investigate the curvature dependence and the possible existence of a contribution to gamma which is proportional to the logarithm of the radius of curvature. Moreover, by treating the curved wall as a second component at infinite dilution, we provide an analytical expression for the surface tension of a hard-sphere fluid close to arbitrary hard convex walls. The agreement between the analytical expression and DFT is good. Our results show no signs for the existence of a logarithmic term in the curvature dependence of gamma.},

For example, for even the most studied protein, lysozyme, there is an ongoing debate about whether the observed nucleation is homogeneous or heterogeneous. We review theoretical and simulation work on both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation. As heterogeneous nucleation appears to be much more common than homogeneous nucleation, and as earlier reviews have tended to focus more on homogeneous nucleation, we place particular},

This structure emerges from spatial correlations of dynamics that appear in disordered systems as they approach nonergodic or jammed states. It is characterized in terms of dynamical heterogeneity, facilitation, and excitation lines. These features are associated with a newly discovered class of nonequilibrium phase transitions. Equilibrium properties have little, if anything, to do with it. The broken symmetries of these transitions are obscure or absent in spatial structures, but they are vivid in space-time (i.e., trajectory space). In our view, the glass transition is an example of this class of transitions. The basic ideas and principles we review were originally developed through the analysis of idealized and abstract models. Nevertheless, the central ideas are easily illustrated with reference to molecular dynamics of more realistic atomistic models, and we use that illustrative approach here.},

  abstract = {The morphometric approach (MA) is a powerful tool for calculating a solvation free energy (SFE) and related quantities of solvation thermodynamics of complex molecules. Here, we extend it to a solvent consisting of m components. In the integral equation theories, the SFE is expressed as the sum of m terms each of which comprises solute-component j correlation functions (j = 1,..., m). The MA is applied to each term in a formally separate manner: The term is expressed as a linear combination of the four geometric measures, excluded volume, solvent-accessible surface area, and integrated mean and Gaussian curvatures of the accessible surface, which are calculated for component j. The total number of the geometric measures or the coefficients in the linear combinations is 4m. The coefficients are determined in simple geometries, i.e., for spherical solutes with various diameters in the same multicomponent solvent. The SFE of the spherical solutes are calculated using the radial-symmetric integral equation theory. The extended version of the MA is illustrated for a protein modeled as a set of fused hard spheres immersed in a binary mixture of hard spheres. Several mixtures of different molecular-diameter ratios and compositions and 30 structures of the protein with a variety of radii of gyration are considered for the illustration purpose. The SFE calculated by the MA is compared with that by the direct application of the three-dimensional integral equation theory (3D-IET) to the protein. The deviations of the MA values from the 3D-IET values are less than 1.5\%. The computation time required is over four orders of magnitude shorter than that in the 3D-IET. The MA thus developed is expected to be best suited to analyses concerning the effects of cosolvents such as urea on the structural stability of a protein.},

Small particles are treated grand canonically, their influence being parameterized in terms of their packing fraction in the reservoir, \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. Two specialized Monte Carlo simulation schemes --the geometrical cluster algorithm, and staged particle insertion-- are deployed to obtain accurate depletion potentials for a number of combinations of q\textbackslash{}leq 0.1 and \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. After applying corrections for simulation finite-size effects, the depletion potentials are compared with the prediction of new density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the insertion trick using the Rosenfeld functional and several subsequent modifications. While agreement between the DFT and simulation is generally good, significant discrepancies are evident at the largest reservoir packing fraction accessible to our simulation methods, namely \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r=0.35. These discrepancies are, however, small compared to those between simulation and the much poorer predictions of the Derjaguin approximation at this \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. The recently proposed morphometric approximation performs better than Derjaguin but is somewhat poorer than DFT for the size ratios and small sphere packing fractions that we consider. The effective potentials from simulation, DFT and the morphometric approximation were used to compute the second virial coefficient B\_2 as a function of \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. Comparison of the results enables an assessment of the extent to which DFT can be expected to correctly predict the propensity towards fluid fluid phase separation in additive binary hard sphere mixtures with q\textbackslash{}leq 0.1.},

The implication is that the Hadwiger Theorem does not hold in this case and the surface free energy is given by the Helfrich expansion instead. The value obtained for the bending rigidity is (1) an order of magnitude smaller than the bending constant associated with Gaussian curvature, (2) changes sign as a function of the fluid volume fraction, (3) is independent of the choice for the location of the hard wall.},

  abstract = {The growing sluggishness of glass-forming liquids is thought to be accompanied by growing structural order. The nature of such order, however, remains hotly debated. A decade ago, point-to-set (PTS) correlation lengths were proposed as measures of amorphous order in glass formers, but recent results raise doubts as to their generality. Here, we extend the definition of PTS correlations in order to agnostically capture any type of growing order in liquids, be it local or amorphous. This advance clarifies the nature of PTS correlations, and enables the formulation of a clear distinction between slowing down due to conventional critical ordering from that due to glassiness.},

  abstract = {Sodium nitrate is a main component of aging sea salt aerosol, and its phase behavior has been studied repeatedly with wide ranges observed in the efflorescence relative humidity (RH) in particular. Studies of the efflorescence dynamics of NaNO3 droplets deposited on a ZnSe substrate are reported, using an in situ Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) technique. The time-dependence of the infrared spectra of NaNO3 aerosols accompanying step changes in RH have been measured with high signal-to-noise ratio. From the IR difference spectra recorded, changes of the time-dependent absorption peak area of the O-H stretching band ({$\nu$}-OH, {$\sim$}3400 cm(-1)) and the nitrate out-of-plane bending band ({$\nu$}2-NO3(-), {$\sim$}836 cm(-1)) are obtained. From these measurements, changes in the IR signatures can be attributed to crystalline and solution phase nitrate ions, allowing the volume fraction of the solution droplets that have crystallized to be determined. Then, using these clear signatures of the volume fraction of droplets that have yet to crystallize, the homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation kinetics can be studied from conventional measurements using a steady decline in RH. The nucleation rate measurements confirm that the rate of crystallization in sodium nitrate droplets is considerably less than in ammonium sulfate droplets at any particular degree of solute supersaturation, explaining the wide range of efflorescence RHs observed for sodium nitrate in previous studies. We demonstrate that studying nucleation kinetics using the FTIR-ATR approach has many advantages over brightfield imaging studies on smaller numbers of larger droplets or measurements made on single levitated particles.},

Sample calculations are reported for octane droplets, initially at 300??K with Ro = 0??1, 0??5, 2??5 ?? 10-4m, evaporating into air at temperatures and pressures in the ranges 600-2000??K and 1-10 atm, respectively. It is found that initial size Ro is eliminated from the problem on scaling time with respect to R20 and that the evaporative process becomes quasi-steady with ( R R0)2 = ( R*0 R0)2- ??t R20, as suggested by experiment. Comparisons of solutions using various reference property schemes with those for variable properties show that best agreement obtains using a simple 1 3 rule wherein properties are evaluated at Tr = Ts + (Te-Ts) 3 and m1,r = m1,s + (m1,e- m1,s) 3. The effects of temporal storage of mass species, energy, etc. and radial pressure variations in the vapor phase prove to be negligible, the early transient behavior being solely due to sensible heat effects within the droplet and related variations in vapor-side driving forces. ?? 1975.},

  abstract = {This paper presents research on evaporation of droplets containing dissolved or dispersed solids. Experiments on evaporation kinetics of droplets of water, colloidal silica, sodium sulphate and skimmed milk were performed. The experimental procedure was similar to that proposed by Charlesworth and Marshall (1960, A.I.Ch.E.J. 6, 9-23). Individual droplets were suspended in a controlled air stream and their weight and temperature were measured as evaporation progressed. Video recording of the size and appearance of the droplets was made with magnification close to 100. The temperature was followed by a micro-thermocouple, while the mass was measured by using the deflection of a calibrated glass filament balance. Experimental data were compared with a computer simulation based on a model of heat and mass transfer, both within the droplet and from the droplet surface to surrounding air. Analytical and numerical solution of the set of equations was tested. A good agreement between experimental results and the numerical predictions for a variety of evaporation regimes is reported. Diffusion coefficients for three tested materials are determined. The model includes all stages of evaporation: initial heating and evaporation, quasi-equilibrium evaporation, crust formation and growth, boiling, and porous particle drying. Stage transition criteria are defined. \textcopyright{} 1990.},

  title = {The Excluded Volume of Two-Dimensional Convex Bodies: {{Shape}} Reconstruction and Non-Uniqueness},
  abstract = {In the Onsager model of one-component hard-particle systems, the entire phase behaviour is dictated by a function of relative orientation, which represents the amount of space excluded to one particle by another at this relative orientation. We term this function the excluded volume function. Within the context of two-dimensional convex bodies, we investigate this excluded volume function for one-component systems addressing two related questions. Firstly, given a body can we find the excluded volume function?, Secondly, can we reconstruct a body from its excluded volume function? The former is readily answered via an explicit Fourier series representation, in terms of the support function. However we show the latter question is ill-posed in the sense that solutions are not unique for a large class of bodies. This degeneracy is well characterised however, with two bodies admitting the same excluded volume function if and only if the Fourier coefficients of their support functions differ only in phase. Despite the non-uniqueness issue, we then propose and analyse a method for reconstructing a convex body given its excluded volume function, by means of a discretisation procedure where convex bodies are approximated by zonotopes with a fixed number of sides. It is shown that the algorithm will always asymptotically produce a best \$L\^2\$ approximation of the trial function, within the space of excluded volume functions of centrally symmetric bodies. In particular, if a solution exists, it can be found. Results from a numerical implementation are presented, showing that with only desktop computing power, good approximations to solutions can be readily found.},

  abstract = {The Rosenfeld functional provides excellent results for the prediction of the fluid phase of hard convex particle systems but fails beyond the freezing point. The reason for this limitation is the neglect of orientational and distance correlations beyond the particle diameter. In the current article we resolve this restriction and generalize the fundamental measure theory to an expansion in intersection centers. It is shown that the intersection probability of particle systems is described by an algebra, represented by Rosenfeld's weight functions. For subdiagrams of intersection networks we derive vertex functions that provide the building blocks for the free energy functional. Their application is illustrated by deriving the Rosenfeld functional and its leading correction which is exact in the third virial order. Furthermore, the methods are used to derive an approximate functional for the infinite sum over Mayer ring diagrams. Comparing this result to the White Bear mark II functional, we find general agreement between both results.},

Beginning with a short review of the perturbation expansion of the free-energy functional, we derive two representations of the correlation functionals in rooted and unrooted Mayer diagrams, which are related by a functional derivative. This map allows to transfer the mathematical methods, developed previously for unrooted diagrams, to the current representation in rooted graphs. Translating then the Mayer to Ree-Hoover diagrams and determining their automorphism groups, yields the generic functional for all r-particle distributions. From this we derive the examples of 2- and 3-particle correlations up to four intersection centers and show that already the leading order reproduces the Wertheim, Thiele, Baxter solution for the contact probability of spheres. Another calculation shows the failure of the Kirkwood superposition approximation for any r-particle correlation.},

To evaluate the competing simplified models of the droplet heating, the more-refined, extended model of heat transfer within a moving circulating droplet is considered. A simplified, one-dimensional 'effective conductivity' model is formulated for the transient liquid heating with internal circulation. As an illustration, the dynamic and vaporization histories of the droplets injected into the steady and fluctuating hot air streams are analyzed. \textcopyright{} 1989.},
