  abstract = {The re-examination of the classical droplet vaporization model is made in order to develop the simple but sufficiently accurate calculation algorithm which can be used in spray combustion calculations. The new model includes the effects of variable thermophysical properties, non-unitary Lewis number in the gas film, the effect of the Stefan flow on heat and mass transfer between the droplet and the gas, and the effect of internal circulation and transient liquid heating. To evaluate the competing simplified models of the droplet heating, the more-refined, extended model of heat transfer within a moving circulating droplet is considered. A simplified, one-dimensional 'effective conductivity' model is formulated for the transient liquid heating with internal circulation. As an illustration, the dynamic and vaporization histories of the droplets injected into the steady and fluctuating hot air streams are analyzed. \textcopyright{} 1989.},

For a test case of soft-core Brownian particles the theory yields results for the van Hove function that agree quantitatively with those of our Brownian dynamics computer simulations. At sufficiently high densities the free energy landscape underlying the dynamics exhibits a barrier as a function of the mean particle displacement, shedding new light on the nature of glass formation. For hard spheres confined between parallel planar walls the barrier height oscillates in phase with the local density, implying that the mobility is maximal between layers, which should be experimentally observable in confined colloidal dispersions.},

Here, we present an analytical method for deriving all packings of n spheres in R\^3 satisfying minimal rigidity constraints ({$>$}= 3 contacts per sphere and {$>$}= 3n-6 total contacts). We derive such packings for n {$<$}= 10, and provide a preliminary set of maximal contact packings for 10 {$<$} n {$<$}= 20. The resultant set of packings has some striking features, among them: (i) all minimally rigid packings for n {$<$}= 9 have 3n-6 contacts, (ii) non-rigid packings satisfying minimal rigidity constraints arise for n {$>$}= 9, (iii) the number of ground states (i.e. packings with the maximal number of contacts) oscillates with respect to n, (iv) for 10 {$<$}= n {$<$}= 20 there are only a small number of packings with the maximal number of contacts, and for 10 {$<$}= n {$<$} 13 these are all commensurate with the HCP lattice.

  abstract = {We report a detailed study, using state-of-the-art simulation and theoretical methods, of the depletion potential between a pair of big hard spheres immersed in a reservoir of much smaller hard spheres, the size disparity being measured by the ratio of diameters q=\textbackslash{}sigma\_s/\textbackslash{}sigma\_b. Small particles are treated grand canonically, their influence being parameterized in terms of their packing fraction in the reservoir, \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. Two specialized Monte Carlo simulation schemes --the geometrical cluster algorithm, and staged particle insertion-- are deployed to obtain accurate depletion potentials for a number of combinations of q\textbackslash{}leq 0.1 and \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. After applying corrections for simulation finite-size effects, the depletion potentials are compared with the prediction of new density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the insertion trick using the Rosenfeld functional and several subsequent modifications. While agreement between the DFT and simulation is generally good, significant discrepancies are evident at the largest reservoir packing fraction accessible to our simulation methods, namely \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r=0.35. These discrepancies are, however, small compared to those between simulation and the much poorer predictions of the Derjaguin approximation at this \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. The recently proposed morphometric approximation performs better than Derjaguin but is somewhat poorer than DFT for the size ratios and small sphere packing fractions that we consider. The effective potentials from simulation, DFT and the morphometric approximation were used to compute the second virial coefficient B\_2 as a function of \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. Comparison of the results enables an assessment of the extent to which DFT can be expected to correctly predict the propensity towards fluid fluid phase separation in additive binary hard sphere mixtures with q\textbackslash{}leq 0.1.},

  abstract = {Liquids relax extremely slowly upon approaching the glass state. One explanation is that an entropy crisis, due to the rarefaction of available states, makes it increasingly arduous to reach equilibrium in that regime. Validating this scenario is challenging, because experiments offer limited resolution, while numerical studies lag more than eight orders of magnitude behind experimentally-relevant timescales. In this work we not only close the colossal gap between experiments and simulations but manage to create in-silico configurations that have no experimental analog yet. Deploying a range of computational tools, we obtain four estimates of their configurational entropy. These measurements consistently confirm that the steep entropy decrease observed in experiments is also found in simulations, even beyond the experimental glass transition. Our numerical results thus extend the new observational window into the physics of glasses and reinforce the relevance of an entropy crisis for understanding their formation.},

The important role played by computer simulations in studying and understanding the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is given. The recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics is reviewed. The main theoretical approaches are presented describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, an extensive overview is given of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.

We show that, after coarse-graining over time, the hard-sphere interaction can be described by an effective potential which is exactly logarithmic at the random close packing c. This allows to define normal modes, and to apply recent results valid for elastic networks: rigidity is a non-local property of the packing geometry, and is characterized by some length scale l* which diverges at c (Wyart M., Nagel S.

These hard spheres have been widely used in fundamental studies of nucleation, crystallization, and glass formation. Most authors describe the interaction as "nearly" hard sphere. In this paper we directly measure this interaction, using layers of PHSA adsorbed onto mica sheets in a surfaces force apparatus. We find that the layers, in appropriate solvents, have no long-range interaction. When the solvent is decahydronaphthalene (decalin), the repulsion rises from zero to the maximum measurable over a distance range of 15-20 nm. The data is converted to equivalent forces between spheres of different diameters, and modeled using a hard core potential. Using zeroth-order perturbation theory and computer simulation, we demonstrate that the equation of state does not deviate from that of a perfect hard-sphere system under any relevant experimental conditions.},

Particular attention is paid to investigate the curvature dependence and the possible existence of a contribution to gamma which is proportional to the logarithm of the radius of curvature. Moreover, by treating the curved wall as a second component at infinite dilution, we provide an analytical expression for the surface tension of a hard-sphere fluid close to arbitrary hard convex walls. The agreement between the analytical expression and DFT is good. Our results show no signs for the existence of a logarithmic term in the curvature dependence of gamma.},

  abstract = {The wetting behavior of a liquid on solid substrates is governed by the nature of the effective interaction between the liquid-gas and the solid-liquid interfaces, which is described by the binding or wetting potential \$g(h)\$ which is an excess free energy per unit area that depends on the liquid film height \$h\$. Given a microscopic theory for the liquid, to determine \$g(h)\$ one must calculate the free energy for liquid films of any given value of \$h\$; i.e. one needs to create and analyze out-of-equilibrium states, since at equilibrium there is a unique value of \$h\$, specified by the temperature and chemical potential of the surrounding gas. Here we introduce a Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) approach to calculate \$g(h)\$ and illustrate the method by applying it in conjunction with a microscopic lattice density functional theory for the liquid. We show too that the NEB results are identical to those obtained with an established method based on using a fictitious additional potential to stabilize the non-equilibrium states. The advantages of the NEB approach are discussed.},

  abstract = {Defining the entropy of classical particles raises a number of paradoxes and ambiguities, some of which have been known for over a century. Several, such as Gibbs' paradox, involve the fact that classical particles are distinguishable, and in textbooks these are often `resolved' by appeal to the quantum-mechanical indistinguishability of atoms or molecules of the same type. However, questions then remain of how to correctly define the entropy of large poly-atomic particles such as colloids in suspension, of which no two are exactly alike. By performing experiments on such colloids, one can establish that certain definitions of the classical entropy fit the data, while others in the literature do not. Specifically, the experimental facts point firmly to an `informatic' interpretation that dates back to Gibbs: entropy is determined by the number of microstates that we as observers choose to treat as equivalent when we identify a macrostate. This approach, unlike some others, can account for the existence of colloidal crystals, and for the observed abundances of colloidal clusters of different shapes. We also address some lesser-known paradoxes whereby the physics of colloidal assemblies, which ought to be purely classical, seems to involve quantum mechanics directly. The experimental symptoms of such involvement are predicted to be `isotope effects' in which colloids with different inertial masses, but otherwise identical sizes and properties, show different aggregation statistics. These paradoxes are caused by focussing one's attention on some classical degrees while neglecting others; when all are treated equally, all isotope effects are found to vanish.},

  abstract = {We review a theoretical perspective of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids and the glass transition, a perspective developed during this past decade based on the structure of trajectory space. This structure emerges from spatial correlations of dynamics that appear in disordered systems as they approach nonergodic or jammed states. It is characterized in terms of dynamical heterogeneity, facilitation, and excitation lines. These features are associated with a newly discovered class of nonequilibrium phase transitions. Equilibrium properties have little, if anything, to do with it. The broken symmetries of these transitions are obscure or absent in spatial structures, but they are vivid in space-time (i.e., trajectory space). In our view, the glass transition is an example of this class of transitions. The basic ideas and principles we review were originally developed through the analysis of idealized and abstract models. Nevertheless, the central ideas are easily illustrated with reference to molecular dynamics of more realistic atomistic models, and we use that illustrative approach here.},

They are both examples of "functional data", which have become a prevailing type of data. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool and in sparse data situations can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single or multiple index methods we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models, such as time warping, manifold learning, and dynamic modeling with empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

  abstract = {Glasses are amorphous solids whose constituent particles are caged by their neighbours and thus cannot flow. This sluggishness is often ascribed to the free energy landscape containing multiple minima (basins) separated by high barriers. Here we show, using theory and numerical simulation, that the landscape is much rougher than is classically assumed. Deep in the glass, it undergoes a 'roughness transition' to fractal basins, which brings about isostaticity and marginal stability on approaching jamming. Critical exponents for the basin width, the weak force distribution and the spatial spread of quasi-contacts near jamming can be analytically determined. Their value is found to be compatible with numerical observations. This advance incorporates the jamming transition of granular materials into the framework of glass theory. Because temperature and pressure control what features of the landscape are experienced, glass mechanics and transport are expected to reflect the features of the topology we discuss here.},

Present methods for computing volumes of macromolecules from crystallographically determined atomic coordinates introduce numerical errors that are, in the case of highly refined protein structures, larger than the experimental errors in the determination of the atomic coordinates. In order to obtain the maximum benefit from this high-quality experimental data, it is necessary to develop a volume-computation method whose numerical error is significantly less than the experimental error. Such a method is presented here. The molecule is modeled as a static collection of hard spheres which completely exclude a spherical probe representing a solvent molecule. van der Waals volumes are computed exactly, and solvent-excluded volumes are computed with an error of about 0.01\%. The method's accuracy makes it particularly useful for comparing three-dimensional structures of a macromolecule in slightly differing conformations. Causes of such differences include temperature, oxidation state, presence of ligands, crystal form, and X-ray crystallographic refinement technique. Molecular volume changes during energy minimization, molecular dynamics simulation, and X-ray refinement can be monitored. This approach should also be of general utility in measuring the volumes of packing defects in protein interiors, ligand-binding pockets on protein surfaces, and gaps between molecules at subunit interfaces. Because the volume is defined analytically, it can be differentiated for use in energy functions.},

In the glassy regime, the two models possess a similar pair structure, yet their dynamics differ markedly. The static triplet correlation functions S(3) indicate that the local ordering is more pronounced in the Lennard-Jones model, an observation consistent with its slower dynamics. A comparison of the direct triplet correlation functions c(3) reveals that these structural differences are due, to a good extent, to an amplification of the small discrepancies observed at the pair level. We demonstrate the existence of a broad, positive peak at small wave-vectors and angles in c(3). In this portion of k-space, slight, systematic differences between the models are observed, revealing "genuine" three-body contributions to the triplet structure. The possible role of the low-k features of c(3) and the implications of our results for dynamic theories of the glass transition are discussed.},

By analysing the effect of the range of the interatomic forces on the multidimensional potential energy surfaces of bulk material and clusters, a microscopic view of this phenomenon is provided. Structural analysis of the minima on the potential energy surface provides evidence for the polytetrahedral character of the liquid phase, and allows us to examine the evolution of the phase-like forms of clusters to the bulk limit. We find that essentially bulk-like liquid structure can develop in clusters with as few as 55 atoms. The effect of the range of the potential on the thermodynamics is illustrated by a series of simulations of 55-atom clusters. For small clusters bound by long-ranged potentials the lowest energy minimum has an amorphous structure typical of the liquidlike state. This suggests an explanation for the transition from electronic to geometric magic numbers observed in the mass spectra of sodium clusters.},

  abstract = {We have attempted to find the global minima of clusters containing between 20 and 80 atoms bound by the Morse potential as a function of the range of the interatomic force. The effect of decreasing the range is to destabilize strained structures, and hence the global minimum changes from icosahedral to decahedral to face-centred-cubic as the range is decreased. For N{$>$}45 the global minima associated with a long-ranged potential have polytetrahedral structures involving defects called disclination lines. For the larger clusters the network of disclination lines is disordered and the global minimum has an amorphous structure resembling a liquid. The size evolution of polytetrahedral packings enables us to study the development of bulk liquid structure in finite systems. As many experiments on the structure of clusters only provide indirect structural information, these results will be very useful in aiding the interpretation of experiment. They also provide candidate structures for theoretical studies using more specific and computationally expensive descriptions of the interatomic interactions. Furthermore, Morse clusters provide a rigorous testing ground for global optimization methods.},

Recently, geometric motifs have been identified in glassy liquids, but a causal link between these motifs and solidification remains elusive. One 'smoking gun' for such a link would be identical scaling of structural and dynamic lengthscales on approaching the glass transition, but this is highly controversial. Here we introduce an information theoretic approach to determine correlations in displacement for particle relaxation encoded in the initial configuration of a glass-forming liquid. We uncover two populations of particles, one inclined to relax quickly, the other slowly. Each population is correlated with local density and geometric motifs. Our analysis further reveals a dynamic lengthscale similar to that associated with structural properties, which may resolve the discrepancy between structural and dynamic lengthscales.},

From the Gibbs inequality one first derives a variational principle for the grand potential as a functional of a trial many-body distribution. This functional is minimized in two stages. The first step consists of a constrained search of all many-body distributions that generate a given one-body density. The result can be split into internal and external contributions to the total grand potential. In contrast to the original approach by Mermin and Evans, here the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional is defined by an explicit expression that does not refer to an external potential in order to generate the given one-body density. The second step consists of minimizing with respect to the one-body density. We show that this framework can be applied in a straightforward way to the canonical ensemble.},

How long do they last? How much do dynamics vary between the fastest and slowest regions? Why do these heterogeneities arise?

Abstract. \textendash{} We argue that for complete wetting at a curved substrate (wall) the wall-fluid surface tension is non-analytic in R -1 i , the curvature of the wall, and that the density profile of the fluid near the wall acquires a contribution proportional to the gas-liquid surface tension \texttimes{}R -1 i plus higher-order contributions which are non-analytic in R -1 i . These predictions are confirmed by results of density functional calculations for the square-well model of a liquid ad-sorbed on a hard sphere and on a hard cylinder where complete wetting by gas (drying) occurs. The implications of our results for the solvation of big solvophobic particles are discussed. Understanding the adsorption of fluids at solid substrates has taken on new importance with recent advances in the controlled fabrication of tailored surfaces for applications in mi-crofluidics and other areas [1]. Much experimental [2] and theoretical effort [3] is concerned with wetting and associated interfacial transitions in wedge geometry and recently attention has turned to wetting at an apex [4]. It is becoming increasingly clear that substrate geom-etry can have a profound influence on the nature of fluid adsorption and, in particular, on wetting characteristics making these quite different from those at a planar substrate. Here we consider complete wetting at two substrates that have simple geometries, namely a single sphere of radius R s and an infinitely long cylinder of radius R c . Using an effective interfacial Hamiltonian approach [5] combined with exact microscopic sum-rules for the density profile of the fluid near a hard wall, we show that in the limit R i {$\rightarrow$} {$\infty$}, with i = s, c, the surface tension of the substrate (wall)-fluid interface is non-analytic in the curvature R -1 i},

For thermodynamic states lying close to the liquid binodal, where the chemical potential deviation deltamu is identical with mu-muco(T) is very small and positive, complete wetting by gas (drying) occurs and two regimes of interfacial behavior can be identified. These are characterized by the length scale Rc=2gamma(gl)infinity/(Deltarhodeltamu), where gamma(gl)infinity is the planar gas-liquid surface tension and Deltarho is the difference in coexisting densities at temperature T. For R{$>$}Rc, the interfacial free energy and the density profile of the fluid near the hard wall can be expanded in powers of the curvature R(-1), in keeping with the analysis of Stillinger and Cotter [J.

  abstract = {An operator calculus is developed applicable to problems in the electron theory of metals. It differs from the common operator calculus of the quantum theory in the fact that the wave function is defined in a finite space (the atomic polyhedron) bounded by a finite surface. This leads to the introduction of surface operators. The position operator X cannot be developed with respect to the proper functions of the Hamiltonian. Instead an operator [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{$>$} is introduced, which is essentially the Fourier development of X. Thus there are three fundamental types of operators: the differential operator P, the multiplication operator [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{$>$} and the surface operators. It is shown that with the help of these a consistent calculus can be developed.},

Recent theoretical developments suggest that the coupling of quantum Hall effect with a superconductor can provide a fertile ground for realizing exotic topological excitations such as non-abelian Majorana fermions or Fibonacci particles. As a step toward that goal, we report observation of Andreev reflection at the junction of a quantum Hall edge state in a single layer graphene and a quasi-two dimensional niobium diselenide (NbSe2) superconductor. Our principal finding is the observation of an anomalous finite-temperature conductance peak located precisely at the Dirac point providing a definitive evidence for inter-Landau level Andreev reflection in a quantum Hall system. Our observations are well supported by detailed numerical simulations, which offer additional insight into the role of the edge states in Andreev physics. This study paves the way for investigating analogous Andreev reflection in a fractional quantum Hall system coupled to a superconductor to realize exotic quasiparticles.},

In order to quantify deviations from the Hadwiger form we extend standard fundamental measure theory of the bulk fluid by introducing additional scaled-particle variables which allow for the description of non-Hadwiger coefficients. The theory is in excellent agreement with recent computer simulations. The fact that the leading non-Hadwiger coefficient is one order of magnitude smaller than the smallest Hadwiger coefficient lends confidence to the numerous results that have been previously obtained within standard morphological thermodynamics.},

In the limit {$\chi$} {$\rightarrow$} 2, the mixture EOS of Santos et al. [Mol.

From the low-density limit of the EOS, the value {$\chi$} {$\approx$} 0.8 is extracted, which is shown to yield a mixture EOS that is significantly more accurate than the expressions due to Santos et al. and Martin et al. In particular, the systematic deviation inherent to these prior results is remedied.},

@article{HendersonMP1985,
  abstract = {We study the approach to complete wetting by gas at the interface between a repulsive wall and dense liquid, paying particular attention to the basic model consisting of a hard-wall system approaching bulk liquid-vapour coexistence. This class of wetting phenomena is of special interest from the point of view of the compressibility route to interfacial statistical mechanics and for its suitability to direct observation by computer simulation. On the theoretical side, there exists a battery of exact sum rules that are of direct relevance to the problem and it is possible to make use of capillary wave fluctuation theory in almost the same form as has been developed for the study of liquid-vapour interfaces. The main conclusion of our study is that in the approach to complete wetting the capillary wave fluctuations of the developing liquid-vapour inter-face continue to manifest themselves at the wall, even when the liquid is separated from the wall by a macroscopic layer of gas. This implies a diverg-ing transverse correlation length, \textasciitilde{}il, determined by the surface tension and the limiting gradient of the density profile near the wall. When combined with the fluctuation theory result for the surface compressibility sum rule, linking 411 to the behaviour of the adsorption, one can derive the complete wetting exponents and corresponding amplitudes, purely from the form of the density profile. The results are directly analogous to the predictions of lattice models and Landau theory; for example, for three-dimensional systems with short-range interparticle interactions we confirm that gaussian fluctuations do not alter the complete wetting exponents from their mean-field values. To confirm the dramatic theoretical predictions for the pair distribution function near the wall, we undertook an extensive computer simulation study of the approach to complete wetting by gas at the interface between square-well liquid and a hard wall. Density profiles and pressure tensors were mea-sured at points along a particular isotherm, in order to obtain a full thermodynamic description of the wetting region. One particular system, close to bulk liquid-vapour coexistence, was chosen for further study in which the transverse surface structure factor was calculated as a function of wavelength and position, and the pair distribution function for particles on the wall was determined. We find the simulation results to be unambiguously in agreement with theory. A remarkably successful measurement of the capil-lary wave pair correlations is obtained, because the low density next to the wall results in essentially weak-gas short-range correlations that are virtually decoupled from the long-range fluctuation contribution. Here, the effects of finite wall area are put to good use.},

  abstract = {Particles interacting with short-ranged potentials have attracted increasing interest, partly for their ability to model mesoscale systems such as colloids interacting via DNA or depletion. We consider the free-energy landscape of such systems as the range of the potential goes to zero. In this limit, the landscape is entirely defined by geometrical manifolds, plus a single control parameter. These manifolds are fundamental objects that do not depend on the details of the interaction potential and provide the starting point from which any quantity characterizing the system--equilibrium or nonequilibrium--can be computed for arbitrary potentials. To consider dynamical quantities we compute the asymptotic limit of the Fokker-Planck equation and show that it becomes restricted to the low-dimensional manifolds connected by "sticky" boundary conditions. To illustrate our theory, we compute the low-dimensional manifolds for n {$\leq$} 8 identical particles, providing a complete description of the lowest-energy parts of the landscape including floppy modes with up to 2 internal degrees of freedom. The results can be directly tested on colloidal clusters. This limit is a unique approach for understanding energy landscapes, and our hope is that it can also provide insight into finite-range potentials.},

Compared to monomer MEPs, polymer MEPs favor intermediate structural symmetry. We also examine the packing-preparation dependence for longer single chains using molecular dynamics simulations. For slow temperature quenches, chains form crystallites with close-packed cores. As the quench rate increases, the core size decreases and the exterior becomes more disordered.

Comparisons of solutions using various reference property schemes with those for variable properties show that best agreement obtains using a simple 1 3 rule wherein properties are evaluated at Tr = Ts + (Te-Ts) 3 and m1,r = m1,s + (m1,e- m1,s) 3. The effects of temporal storage of mass species, energy, etc. and radial pressure variations in the vapor phase prove to be negligible, the early transient behavior being solely due to sensible heat effects within the droplet and related variations in vapor-side driving forces. ?? 1975.},

Here, we present a theoretical framework that yields near-quantitative accuracy for the time-dependent correlation functions of a glass-forming system over a broad density range. Our approach requires only simple static structural information as input and is based entirely on first principles. Owing to its ab initio nature, the framework offers a unique platform to study the relation between structure and dynamics in glass-forming matter, and paves the way towards a systematically correctable and ultimately fully quantitative theory of microscopic glassy dynamics.},

  abstract = {Networks of particles connected by springs model many condensed-matter systems, from colloids interacting with a short-range potential, to complex fluids near jamming, to self-assembled lattices, to origami-inspired materials. Under small thermal fluctuations the vibrational entropy of a ground state is given by the harmonic approximation if it has no zero-frequency vibrational modes, yet such singular modes are at the epicenter of many interesting behaviors in the systems above. We consider a system of \$N\$ spherical particles, and directly account for the singularities that arise in the sticky limit where the pairwise interaction is strong and short ranged. Although the contribution to the partition function from singular clusters diverges in the limit, its asymptotic value can be calculated and depends on only two parameters, characterizing the depth and range of the potential. The result holds for systems that are second-order rigid, a geometric characterization that describes all known ground-state (rigid) sticky clusters. To illustrate our theory we address the question of emergence: how does crystalline order arise in large systems when it is strongly disfavored in small ones? We calculate the partition functions of all known rigid clusters up to \$N\textbackslash{}leq 19\$, and show the cluster landscape is dominated by hyperstatic clusters (those with more than \$3N-6\$ contacts) -- singular and isostatic clusters are far less frequent, despite their extra vibrational and configurational entropies. Since the most hyperstatic clusters are close to fragments of a close-packed lattice, this underlies the emergence of order in sticky-sphere systems, even those as small as \$N=10\$.},

  abstract = {The morphometric approach (MA) is a powerful tool for calculating a solvation free energy (SFE) and related quantities of solvation thermodynamics of complex molecules. Here, we extend it to a solvent consisting of m components. In the integral equation theories, the SFE is expressed as the sum of m terms each of which comprises solute-component j correlation functions (j = 1,..., m). The MA is applied to each term in a formally separate manner: The term is expressed as a linear combination of the four geometric measures, excluded volume, solvent-accessible surface area, and integrated mean and Gaussian curvatures of the accessible surface, which are calculated for component j. The total number of the geometric measures or the coefficients in the linear combinations is 4m. The coefficients are determined in simple geometries, i.e., for spherical solutes with various diameters in the same multicomponent solvent. The SFE of the spherical solutes are calculated using the radial-symmetric integral equation theory. The extended version of the MA is illustrated for a protein modeled as a set of fused hard spheres immersed in a binary mixture of hard spheres. Several mixtures of different molecular-diameter ratios and compositions and 30 structures of the protein with a variety of radii of gyration are considered for the illustration purpose. The SFE calculated by the MA is compared with that by the direct application of the three-dimensional integral equation theory (3D-IET) to the protein. The deviations of the MA values from the 3D-IET values are less than 1.5\%. The computation time required is over four orders of magnitude shorter than that in the 3D-IET. The MA thus developed is expected to be best suited to analyses concerning the effects of cosolvents such as urea on the structural stability of a protein.},

In the current article we resolve this restriction and generalize the fundamental measure theory to an expansion in intersection centers. It is shown that the intersection probability of particle systems is described by an algebra, represented by Rosenfeld's weight functions. For subdiagrams of intersection networks we derive vertex functions that provide the building blocks for the free energy functional. Their application is illustrated by deriving the Rosenfeld functional and its leading correction which is exact in the third virial order. Furthermore, the methods are used to derive an approximate functional for the infinite sum over Mayer ring diagrams. Comparing this result to the White Bear mark II functional, we find general agreement between both results.},

Beginning with a short review of the perturbation expansion of the free-energy functional, we derive two representations of the correlation functionals in rooted and unrooted Mayer diagrams, which are related by a functional derivative. This map allows to transfer the mathematical methods, developed previously for unrooted diagrams, to the current representation in rooted graphs. Translating then the Mayer to Ree-Hoover diagrams and determining their automorphism groups, yields the generic functional for all r-particle distributions. From this we derive the examples of 2- and 3-particle correlations up to four intersection centers and show that already the leading order reproduces the Wertheim, Thiele, Baxter solution for the contact probability of spheres. Another calculation shows the failure of the Kirkwood superposition approximation for any r-particle correlation.},

  abstract = {A program is described for drawing the van der Waal's surface of a protein molecule. An extension of the program permits the accessibility of atoms, or groups of atoms, to solvent or solute molecules of specified size to be quantitatively assessed. As defined in this study, the accessibility is proportional to surface area. The accessibility of all atoms in the twenty common amino acids in model tripeptides of the type Ala-X-Ala are given for defined conformation. The accessibilities are also given for all atoms in ribonuclease-S, lysozyme and myogoblin. Internal cavities are defined and discussed. Various summaries of these data are provided. Forty to fifty per cent of the surface area of each protein is occupied by non-polar atoms. The actual numerical results are sensitive to the values chosen for the van der Waal's radii of the various groups. Since there is uncertainty over the correct values for these radii, the derived numbers should only be used as a qualitative guide at this stage. The average change in accessibility for the atoms of all three proteins in going from a hypothetical extended chain to the folded conformation of the native protein is about a factor of 3. This number applies to both polar (nitrogen and oxygen) and non-polar (carbon and sulfur) atoms considered separately. The larger non-polar amino acids tend to be more ``buried'' in the native form of all three proteins. However, for all classes and for residues within a given class the accessibility changes on folding tend to be highly variable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colloids consist of solid or liquid particles, each about a few hundred nanometers in size, dispersed in a fluid and kept suspended by thermal fluctuations. Where-as natural colloids are the stuff of paint, milk, and glue, synthetic colloids with well-controlled size distributions and interactions are a model system for understanding phase transitions. These colloids can form crystals and other phases of matter seen in atomic and molecular systems, but because the particles are large enough to be seen under an optical microscope, the microscopic mechanisms of phase transi-tions can be directly observed. Furthermore, their ability to spontaneously form phases that are ordered on the scale of visible wavelengths makes colloids useful building blocks for opti-cal materials such as photonic crystals. Because the interactions between particles can be altered and the effects on structure directly observed, experiments on colloids offer a controlled ap-proach toward understanding and harnessing self-assembly, a fundamental topic in materials science, condensed-matter physics, and biophysics.},

Many of these clusters are subsets of close-packed lattices. As the number of particles increases from 6 to 10, we observe the emergence of a complex free-energy landscape with a small number of ground states and many local minima.},

  abstract = {We propose a method to determine the locally preferred structure of model liquids. This latter is obtained numerically as the global minimum of the effective energy surface of clusters formed by small numbers of particles embedded in a liquid-like environment. The effective energy is the sum of the intra-cluster interaction potential and of an external field that describes the influence of the embedding bulk liquid at a mean-field level. Doing so we minimize the surface effects present in isolated clusters without introducing the full blown geometrical frustration present in bulk condensed phases. We find that the locally preferred structure of the Lennard-Jones liquid is an icosahedron, and that the liquid-like environment only slightly reduces the relative stability of the icosahedral cluster. The influence of the boundary conditions on the nature of the ground-state configuration of Lennard-Jones clusters is also discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents research on evaporation of droplets containing dissolved or dispersed solids. Experiments on evaporation kinetics of droplets of water, colloidal silica, sodium sulphate and skimmed milk were performed. The experimental procedure was similar to that proposed by Charlesworth and Marshall (1960, A.I.Ch.E.J. 6, 9-23). Individual droplets were suspended in a controlled air stream and their weight and temperature were measured as evaporation progressed. Video recording of the size and appearance of the droplets was made with magnification close to 100. The temperature was followed by a micro-thermocouple, while the mass was measured by using the deflection of a calibrated glass filament balance. Experimental data were compared with a computer simulation based on a model of heat and mass transfer, both within the droplet and from the droplet surface to surrounding air. Analytical and numerical solution of the set of equations was tested. A good agreement between experimental results and the numerical predictions for a variety of evaporation regimes is reported. Diffusion coefficients for three tested materials are determined. The model includes all stages of evaporation: initial heating and evaporation, quasi-equilibrium evaporation, crust formation and growth, boiling, and porous particle drying. Stage transition criteria are defined. \textcopyright{} 1990.},

Here we first give a general scaled-particle method for convex bodies in terms of the characteristic geometrical measures of the depletion agent, i.e., its volume, surface area, and integrated mean curvature, in mixtures with hard spheres. Second, we show that similar results can be derived from fundamental-measure theory. This different approach allows us to get a deep insight into the meaning of the various contributions to the theory from a geometrical point of view. From these two methods we arrive at a generalized "recipe" to free-volume theory. This recipe can be based on a desired equation of state for any convex shape of the depletion agents and is also valid for (polydisperse) mixtures of those. This is illustrated by mixtures of spheres with ellipsoids, spheres with several geometries as models for disklike mesogens, e.g., gibbsite, as well as depletion of spheres due to bar-shaped colloids, e.g., goethite.},

  abstract = {Hard spheres are ubiquitous in condensed matter: they have been used as models for liquids, crystals, colloidal systems, granular systems, and powders. Packings of hard spheres are of even wider interest, as they are related to important problems in information theory, such as digitalization of signals, error correcting codes, and optimization problems. In three dimensions the densest packing of identical hard spheres has been proven to be the FCC lattice, and it is conjectured that the closest packing is ordered (a regular lattice, e.g, a crystal) in low enough dimension. Still, amorphous packings have attracted a lot of interest, because for polydisperse colloids and granular materials the crystalline state is not obtained in experiments for kinetic reasons. We review here a theory of amorphous packings, and more generally glassy states, of hard spheres that is based on the replica method: this theory gives predictions on the structure and thermodynamics of these states. In dimensions between two and six these predictions can be successfully compared with numerical simulations. We will also discuss the limit of large dimension where an exact solution is possible. Some of the results we present here have been already published, but others are original: in particular we improved the discussion of the large dimension limit and we obtained new results on the correlation function and the contact force distribution in three dimensions. We also try here to clarify the main assumptions that are beyond our theory and in particular the relation between our static computation and the dynamical procedures used to construct amorphous packings.},

  abstract = {The energetics and assembly pathways of small clusters may yield insights into processes occurring at the earliest stages of nucleation. We use a model system consisting of micrometer-sized, spherical colloidal particles to study the structure and dynamics of small clusters, where the number of particles is small (N [less-than-or-equal] 10). The particles interact through a short-range depletion attraction with a depth of a few kBT. We describe two methods to form colloidal clusters, one based on isolating the particles in microwells and another based on directly assembling clusters in the gas phase using optical tweezers. We use the first technique to obtain ensemble-averaged probabilities of cluster structures as a function of N. These experiments show that clusters with symmetries compatible with crystalline order are rarely formed under equilibrium conditions. We use the second technique to study the dynamics of the clusters, and in particular how they transition between free-energy minima. To monitor the clusters we use a fast three-dimensional imaging technique, digital holographic microscopy, that can resolve the positions of each particle in the cluster with 30-45 nm precision on millisecond timescales. The real-space measurements allow us to obtain estimates for the lifetimes of the energy minima and the transition states. It is not yet clear whether the observed dynamics are relevant for small nuclei, which may not have sufficient time to transition between states before other particles or clusters attach to them. However, the measurements do provide some glimpses into how systems containing a small number of particles traverse their free-energy landscape.},

In contrast to brute force DFT, our approach requires only the equilibrium density profile of the small particles \{\textbackslash{}em before\} the big (test) particle is inserted. For a big particle near a planar wall or a cylinder or another fixed big particle the relevant density profiles are functions of a single variable, which avoids the numerical complications inherent in brute force DFT. We implement our approach for additive hard-sphere mixtures. By investigating the depletion potential for high size asymmetries we assess the regime of validity of the well-known Derjaguin approximation for hard-sphere mixtures and argue that this fails. We provide an accurate parametrization of the depletion potential in hard-sphere fluids which should be useful for effective Hamiltonian studies of phase behavior and colloid structure.},

We theoretically investigate the existence of marginal stability in a generic model for structural glass-formers, combining analytical calculations in infinite dimensions to computer simulations in three dimensions. While mean-field theory predicts the existence of a Gardner phase transition towards a marginally stable glass phase at low temperatures, simulations show no hint of diverging timescales or lengthscales, but reveal instead the presence of sparse localized defects. Our results suggest that the Gardner transition is deeply affected by finite dimensional fluctuations, and raise issues about the relevance of marginal stability in structural glasses away from jamming.},

  abstract = {An overview of several recent developments in density functional theory for classical inhomogeneous liquids is given. We show how Levy's constrained search method can be used to derive the variational principle that underlies density functional theory. An advantage of the method is that the Helmholtz free energy as a functional of a trial one-body density is given as an explicit expression, without reference to an external potential as is the case in the standard Mermin-Evans proof by reductio ad absurdum. We show how to generalize the approach in order to express the internal energy as a functional of the one-body density distribution and of the local entropy distribution. Here the local chemical potential and the bulk temperature play the role of Lagrange multipliers in the Euler-Lagrange equations for minimiziation of the functional. As an explicit approximation for the free-energy functional for hard sphere mixtures, the diagrammatic structure of Rosenfeld's fundamental measure density unctional is laid out. Recent extensions, based on the Kierlik-Rosinberg scalar weight functions, to binary and ternary non-additive hard sphere mixtures are described.},

For example, for even the most studied protein, lysozyme, there is an ongoing debate about whether the observed nucleation is homogeneous or heterogeneous. We review theoretical and simulation work on both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation.

For pure hard spheres and a mixture this provides an equation of state that interpolates between the ideal gas low density limit and an ideal glass high density limit, and includes a thermodynamic glass transition. On a finite timescale, a real glass transition pre-empts the ideal one. The real transition occurs when the root-mean-square displacement of the spheres, on the simulation timescale, becomes smaller than a sphere diameter.},

A derivation of an equation for the crystallization pressure based on the chemical potentials of the loaded and the unloaded faces of a growing crystal is provided. The equation obtained is compared to other equations available in the literature and the different approaches are discussed in detail. The treatment also includes the non-ideal behavior of the liquid phase using the ion interaction approach (Pitzer equations) which is well-established in solution thermodynamics. Incorporating the ion interaction equations in the crystallization pressure equation yields a quite simple expression that appears to be more convenient than previous treatments. The equation is applied to calculate crystallization pressures for supersaturated solutions of aqueous NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4, and MgSO4 including the various hydrated forms of these salts. Depending on the nature of the salt, neglecting the non-ideal behavior may cause considerable error in crystallization pressure calculations. Finally, it is emphasized that the basic assumption of non-uniform pressure is fundamental to understand the dynamics of crystallization pressure evolving in porous materials.},

This requires classification of particle configurations according to multidimensional potential-energy minima that can be reached by steepest-descent paths ("quenches"). Such classifications have been constructed for several starting configurations in the solid, fluid, and coexistence phases of the two-dimensional Gaussian core model. These quenches reveal a remarkable degree of polycrystalline order hidden within the fluid phase by "vibrational" distortion, and that order appears to have a large correlation length. The results suggest that melting hinges upon defect softening in the quenched packings, and a crude "theory" of melting for the Gaussian core model is developed in the Appendix},

In this paper we briefly review the reasons for both its popularity and its controversy. We emphasize the need for the development of approaches that would be able to evaluate corrections to and extensions of the existing (standard) mode-coupling theory. Next, we review our diagrammatic formulation of the dynamics of interacting Brownian particles. We show that within this approach the standard mode-coupling theory can be derived in a very simple way. Finally, we use our diagrammatic approach to calculate two corrections to the mode-coupling theory's expression for the so-called irreducible memory function. These corrections involve re-summations of well defined classes of non-mode-coupling diagrams.},

@article{Taylor2018,
  abstract = {In the Onsager model of one-component hard-particle systems, the entire phase behaviour is dictated by a function of relative orientation, which represents the amount of space excluded to one particle by another at this relative orientation. We term this function the excluded volume function. Within the context of two-dimensional convex bodies, we investigate this excluded volume function for one-component systems addressing two related questions. Firstly, given a body can we find the excluded volume function?, Secondly, can we reconstruct a body from its excluded volume function? The former is readily answered via an explicit Fourier series representation, in terms of the support function. However we show the latter question is ill-posed in the sense that solutions are not unique for a large class of bodies. This degeneracy is well characterised however, with two bodies admitting the same excluded volume function if and only if the Fourier coefficients of their support functions differ only in phase. Despite the non-uniqueness issue, we then propose and analyse a method for reconstructing a convex body given its excluded volume function, by means of a discretisation procedure where convex bodies are approximated by zonotopes with a fixed number of sides. It is shown that the algorithm will always asymptotically produce a best \$L\^2\$ approximation of the trial function, within the space of excluded volume functions of centrally symmetric bodies. In particular, if a solution exists, it can be found. Results from a numerical implementation are presented, showing that with only desktop computing power, good approximations to solutions can be readily found.},

Relating glassy behaviour to an underlying, thermodynamic phase transition is a long-standing open question in condensed matter physics. Like experiments, computer simulations are limited by the small time window over which a liquid can be equilibrated. Here we address the challenge of low temperature equilibration using trajectory sampling in a system undergoing a nonequilibrium phase transition. This transition occurs in trajectory space between the normal supercooled liquid and a glassy state rich in low-energy geometric motifs. Our results indicate that this transition might become accessible in equilibrium configurational space at a temperature close to the so-called Kauzmann temperature, and provide a possible route to unify dynamical and thermodynamical theories of the glass transition.},

  abstract = {A new method to treat statistical mechanics in a polydisperse system is described, applicable when the nonideal part of the free energy depends only on a few moments of a size distribution. A simple entropic contribution to the free energy is identified from combinatorial considerations. Although approximate in the general case, the method obtains the exact spinodal curve, critical points, cloud curve, and shadow curve. Polydisperse flory-huggins theory is treated as an example.},

  abstract = {It is shown how certain thermodynamic functions, and also the radial distribution function, can be expressed in terms of the potential energy distribution in a fluid. A miscellany of results is derived from this unified point of view. (i) With g(r) the radial distribution function and {$\Phi$}(r) the pair potential, it is shown that g exp ({$\Phi$}/kT) may be written as a Fourier integral, or as a power series in r 2 the terms of which alternate in sign. (ii) A potential-energy distribution which is independent of the temperature implies an equation of state which is a generalization of a number of well-known approximations. (iii) The grand partition function of the one-dimensional lattice gas is obtained from thermodynamic arguments without evaluating a sum over states. (iv) If in a two-dimensional honeycomb (three-coordinates) lattice gas fr (r=0, 1, 2, 3) is the fraction of all the empty sites which at equilibrium are neighbored by exactly r filled sites, then at the critical density the values of all four of the f\&apos;s as functions of temperature follow from previously known properties of this system; in particular, at the critical point,f 0 = 3/8+5{$\surd$}3/24, f 1 = 1/8+{$\surd$}3/24, f 2 = 1/8\textemdash{$\surd$}3/24, f 3 = 3/8\textendash{}5{$\surd$}3/24.},

  abstract = {We poorly understand the properties of amorphous systems at small length scales, where a continuous elastic description breaks down. This is apparent when one considers their vibrational and transport properties, or the way forces propagate in these solids. Little is known about the microscopic cause of their rigidity. Recently it has been observed numerically that an assembly of elastic particles has a critical behavior near the jamming threshold where the pressure vanishes. At the transition such a system does not behave as a continuous medium at any length scales. When this system is compressed, scaling is observed for the elastic moduli, the coordination number, but also for the density of vibrational modes. In the present work we derive theoretically these results, and show that they apply to various systems such as granular matter and silica, but also to colloidal glasses. In particular we show that: (i) these systems present a large excess of vibrational modes at low frequency in comparison with normal solids, called the "boson peak" in the glass literature. The corresponding modes are very different from plane waves, and their frequency is related to the system coordination; (ii) rigidity is a non-local property of the packing geometry, characterized by a length scale which can be large. For elastic particles this length diverges near the jamming transition; (iii) for repulsive systems the shear modulus can be much smaller than the bulk modulus. We compute the corresponding scaling laws near the jamming threshold. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results to the glass transition, the transport, and the geometry of the random close packing.},

  abstract = {The constraint that packings of hard spheres are stable with respect to rearrangements of the contacts between particles is investigated. This constraint is shown to lead to a bound between the distribution of contact forces P(f) and the pair distribution function g(r). This bound plays a role similar to those found in some glassy materials with long-range interactions, such as the Coulomb gap in Anderson insulators or the distribution of local fields in mean-field spin glasses. If P(f) \textbackslash{}sim f\^(theta) and g(r) \textbackslash{}sim (r-sigma)\^(-gamma), where sigma is the particle diameter, one finds that gamma \textbackslash{}geq 1/(2+theta).

We argue, based on recent simulations using particle-radius-swap dynamics, that only a modest factor in the increase in \{\textbackslash{}tau\}\{\textbackslash{}alpha\} on approach to the glass transition may stem from the growth of a static length, with a vastly larger contribution attributable instead to a slowdown of local dynamics. This reinforces arguments that we base on the observed strong coupling of particle diffusion and density fluctuations in real glasses},

  abstract = {The growing sluggishness of glass-forming liquids is thought to be accompanied by growing structural order. The nature of such order, however, remains hotly debated. A decade ago, point-to-set (PTS) correlation lengths were proposed as measures of amorphous order in glass formers, but recent results raise doubts as to their generality. Here, we extend the definition of PTS correlations in order to agnostically capture any type of growing order in liquids, be it local or amorphous. This advance clarifies the nature of PTS correlations, and enables the formulation of a clear distinction between slowing down due to conventional critical ordering from that due to glassiness.},

However, experimental protocols such as annealing allow little control over the {$\beta$} relaxation for most glasses. Here we report on the {$\beta$} relaxation of toluene in highly stable glasses prepared by physical vapor deposition. At conditions that generate the highest kinetic stability, about 70\% of the {$\beta$} relaxation intensity is suppressed, indicating the proximity of this state to the long-sought "ideal glass." While preparing such a state via deposition takes less than an hour, it would require {$\sim$}3500 years of annealing an ordinary glass to obtain similarly suppressed dynamics.},

@article{ZhangJPCA2014,
  abstract = {Sodium nitrate is a main component of aging sea salt aerosol, and its phase behavior has been studied repeatedly with wide ranges observed in the efflorescence relative humidity (RH) in particular. Studies of the efflorescence dynamics of NaNO3 droplets deposited on a ZnSe substrate are reported, using an in situ Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) technique. The time-dependence of the infrared spectra of NaNO3 aerosols accompanying step changes in RH have been measured with high signal-to-noise ratio. From the IR difference spectra recorded, changes of the time-dependent absorption peak area of the O-H stretching band ({$\nu$}-OH, {$\sim$}3400 cm(-1)) and the nitrate out-of-plane bending band ({$\nu$}2-NO3(-), {$\sim$}836 cm(-1)) are obtained. From these measurements, changes in the IR signatures can be attributed to crystalline and solution phase nitrate ions, allowing the volume fraction of the solution droplets that have crystallized to be determined. Then, using these clear signatures of the volume fraction of droplets that have yet to crystallize, the homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation kinetics can be studied from conventional measurements using a steady decline in RH. The nucleation rate measurements confirm that the rate of crystallization in sodium nitrate droplets is considerably less than in ammonium sulfate droplets at any particular degree of solute supersaturation, explaining the wide range of efflorescence RHs observed for sodium nitrate in previous studies. We demonstrate that studying nucleation kinetics using the FTIR-ATR approach has many advantages over brightfield imaging studies on smaller numbers of larger droplets or measurements made on single levitated particles.},
