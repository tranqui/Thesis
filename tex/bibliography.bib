  abstract = {The re-examination of the classical droplet vaporization model is made in order to develop the simple but sufficiently accurate calculation algorithm which can be used in spray combustion calculations. The new model includes the effects of variable thermophysical properties, non-unitary Lewis number in the gas film, the effect of the Stefan flow on heat and mass transfer between the droplet and the gas, and the effect of internal circulation and transient liquid heating. To evaluate the competing simplified models of the droplet heating, the more-refined, extended model of heat transfer within a moving circulating droplet is considered. A simplified, one-dimensional 'effective conductivity' model is formulated for the transient liquid heating with internal circulation. As an illustration, the dynamic and vaporization histories of the droplets injected into the steady and fluctuating hot air streams are analyzed. \textcopyright{} 1989.},

  abstract = {We show that one may view the self-part and the distinct-part of the van Hove dynamic correlation function of a simple fluid as the one-body density distributions of a binary mixture that evolve in time according to dynamical density functional theory. For a test case of soft-core Brownian particles the theory yields results for the van Hove function that agree quantitatively with those of our Brownian dynamics computer simulations. At sufficiently high densities the free energy landscape underlying the dynamics exhibits a barrier as a function of the mean particle displacement, shedding new light on the nature of glass formation. For hard spheres confined between parallel planar walls the barrier height oscillates in phase with the local density, implying that the mobility is maximal between layers, which should be experimentally observable in confined colloidal dispersions.},

  abstract = {We report a detailed study, using state-of-the-art simulation and theoretical methods, of the depletion potential between a pair of big hard spheres immersed in a reservoir of much smaller hard spheres, the size disparity being measured by the ratio of diameters q=\textbackslash{}sigma\_s/\textbackslash{}sigma\_b. Small particles are treated grand canonically, their influence being parameterized in terms of their packing fraction in the reservoir, \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. Two specialized Monte Carlo simulation schemes --the geometrical cluster algorithm, and staged particle insertion-- are deployed to obtain accurate depletion potentials for a number of combinations of q\textbackslash{}leq 0.1 and \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. After applying corrections for simulation finite-size effects, the depletion potentials are compared with the prediction of new density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the insertion trick using the Rosenfeld functional and several subsequent modifications. While agreement between the DFT and simulation is generally good, significant discrepancies are evident at the largest reservoir packing fraction accessible to our simulation methods, namely \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r=0.35. These discrepancies are, however, small compared to those between simulation and the much poorer predictions of the Derjaguin approximation at this \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. The recently proposed morphometric approximation performs better than Derjaguin but is somewhat poorer than DFT for the size ratios and small sphere packing fractions that we consider. The effective potentials from simulation, DFT and the morphometric approximation were used to compute the second virial coefficient B\_2 as a function of \textbackslash{}eta\_s\^r. Comparison of the results enables an assessment of the extent to which DFT can be expected to correctly predict the propensity towards fluid fluid phase separation in additive binary hard sphere mixtures with q\textbackslash{}leq 0.1.},

This latest equation, with no adjustable parameters except known virial coefficients, is comparable in accuracy both to Pad{\'e} approximants, and to numerical parameterizations of MD data. There is no evidence of nonconvergence at stable fluid densities. The virial pressure begins to deviate significantly from the thermodynamic fluid pressure at or near the freezing density, suggesting that the passage from stable fluid to metastable fluid is associated with a higher-order phase transition; an observation consistent with some previous experimental results. Revised parameters for the crystal equation-of-state [R. J. Speedy, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 10, 4387 (1998)] are also reported.},

Particular attention is paid to investigate the curvature dependence and the possible existence of a contribution to gamma which is proportional to the logarithm of the radius of curvature. Moreover, by treating the curved wall as a second component at infinite dilution, we provide an analytical expression for the surface tension of a hard-sphere fluid close to arbitrary hard convex walls. The agreement between the analytical expression and DFT is good. Our results show no signs for the existence of a logarithmic term in the curvature dependence of gamma.},

  abstract = {We review a theoretical perspective of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids and the glass transition, a perspective developed during this past decade based on the structure of trajectory space. This structure emerges from spatial correlations of dynamics that appear in disordered systems as they approach nonergodic or jammed states. It is characterized in terms of dynamical heterogeneity, facilitation, and excitation lines. These features are associated with a newly discovered class of nonequilibrium phase transitions. Equilibrium properties have little, if anything, to do with it. The broken symmetries of these transitions are obscure or absent in spatial structures, but they are vivid in space-time (i.e., trajectory space). In our view, the glass transition is an example of this class of transitions. The basic ideas and principles we review were originally developed through the analysis of idealized and abstract models. Nevertheless, the central ideas are easily illustrated with reference to molecular dynamics of more realistic atomistic models, and we use that illustrative approach here.},

This sphere is, in effect, rolled over the molecule to generate a smooth outer-surface contour. This surface contour is made up of pieces of spheres and tori that join at circular arcs. The spheres, tori and arcs are defined by analytical expressions in terms of the atomic coordinates, van der Waals radii and the probe radius. The area of each surface piece may be calculated analytically and the surface may be displayed on either vector or raster computer-graphics systems. These methods are useful for studying the structure and interactions of proteins and nucleic acids.},

  abstract = {Volume is a fundamental physical property of molecules that is important in understanding their structure, function, and interactions. Present methods for computing volumes of macromolecules from crystallographically determined atomic coordinates introduce numerical errors that are, in the case of highly refined protein structures, larger than the experimental errors in the determination of the atomic coordinates. In order to obtain the maximum benefit from this high-quality experimental data, it is necessary to develop a volume-computation method whose numerical error is significantly less than the experimental error. Such a method is presented here. The molecule is modeled as a static collection of hard spheres which completely exclude a spherical probe representing a solvent molecule. van der Waals volumes are computed exactly, and solvent-excluded volumes are computed with an error of about 0.01\%. The method's accuracy makes it particularly useful for comparing three-dimensional structures of a macromolecule in slightly differing conformations. Causes of such differences include temperature, oxidation state, presence of ligands, crystal form, and X-ray crystallographic refinement technique. Molecular volume changes during energy minimization, molecular dynamics simulation, and X-ray refinement can be monitored. This approach should also be of general utility in measuring the volumes of packing defects in protein interiors, ligand-binding pockets on protein surfaces, and gaps between molecules at subunit interfaces. Because the volume is defined analytically, it can be differentiated for use in energy functions.},

A consequence of the high supersaturations reached at the onset of nucleation is the very rapid growth of a single skeletal (Hopper) crystal. Experiments on porous media also reveal the formation of Hopper crystals in the entrapped liquid pockets in the porous network and consequently underline the fact that sodium chloride can easily reach high supersaturations, in spite of what is commonly assumed for this salt.

From the Gibbs inequality one first derives a variational principle for the grand potential as a functional of a trial many-body distribution. This functional is minimized in two stages. The first step consists of a constrained search of all many-body distributions that generate a given one-body density. The result can be split into internal and external contributions to the total grand potential. In contrast to the original approach by Mermin and Evans, here the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional is defined by an explicit expression that does not refer to an external potential in order to generate the given one-body density. The second step consists of minimizing with respect to the one-body density. We show that this framework can be applied in a straightforward way to the canonical ensemble.},

This interest has grown in the recent years, because weighted volumes are widely used in implicit solvent models. Applications of the latter in molecular mechanics simulations require that the derivatives of these weighted volumes be known. In this article, we give a formula for the volume derivative of a molecule modeled as a space-filling diagram made up of balls in motion. The formula is given in terms of the weights, radii, and distances between the centers as well as the sizes of the facets of the power diagram restricted to the space-filling diagram. Special attention is given to the detection and treatment of singularities as well as discontinuities of the derivative.},

In order to quantify deviations from the Hadwiger form we extend standard fundamental measure theory of the bulk fluid by introducing additional scaled-particle variables which allow for the description of non-Hadwiger coefficients. The theory is in excellent agreement with recent computer simulations. The fact that the leading non-Hadwiger coefficient is one order of magnitude smaller than the smallest Hadwiger coefficient lends confidence to the numerous results that have been previously obtained within standard morphological thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {Within scaled-particle theory, we construct an equation of state (EOS) for hard-disk mixtures by making use of an additional scaled-particle variable which weighs the densities of the different components by its radii to the power {$\chi$}. This allows us to simultaneously respect exact results pertaining to the cases of a large particle or a point particle being added to the mixture. In the limit {$\chi$} \textrightarrow 2, the mixture EOS of Santos et al. [Mol. Phys. 96, 1 (1999)] is recovered, while the limit {$\chi$} \textrightarrow 0 yields the accurate expression for the interfacial free energy of Martin et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 149, 084701 (2018)]. From the low-density limit of the EOS, the value {$\chi$} {$\approx$} 0.8 is extracted, which is shown to yield a mixture EOS that is significantly more accurate than the expressions due to Santos et al. and Martin et al. In particular, the systematic deviation inherent to these prior results is remedied.},

Sample calculations are reported for octane droplets, initially at 300??K with Ro = 0??1, 0??5, 2??5 ?? 10-4m, evaporating into air at temperatures and pressures in the ranges 600-2000??K and 1-10 atm, respectively. It is found that initial size Ro is eliminated from the problem on scaling time with respect to R20 and that the evaporative process becomes quasi-steady with ( R R0)2 = ( R*0 R0)2- ??t R20, as suggested by experiment. Comparisons of solutions using various reference property schemes with those for variable properties show that best agreement obtains using a simple 1 3 rule wherein properties are evaluated at Tr = Ts + (Te-Ts) 3 and m1,r = m1,s + (m1,e- m1,s) 3. The effects of temporal storage of mass species, energy, etc. and radial pressure variations in the vapor phase prove to be negligible, the early transient behavior being solely due to sensible heat effects within the droplet and related variations in vapor-side driving forces. ?? 1975.},

  abstract = {The morphometric approach (MA) is a powerful tool for calculating a solvation free energy (SFE) and related quantities of solvation thermodynamics of complex molecules. Here, we extend it to a solvent consisting of m components. In the integral equation theories, the SFE is expressed as the sum of m terms each of which comprises solute-component j correlation functions (j = 1,..., m). The MA is applied to each term in a formally separate manner: The term is expressed as a linear combination of the four geometric measures, excluded volume, solvent-accessible surface area, and integrated mean and Gaussian curvatures of the accessible surface, which are calculated for component j. The total number of the geometric measures or the coefficients in the linear combinations is 4m. The coefficients are determined in simple geometries, i.e., for spherical solutes with various diameters in the same multicomponent solvent. The SFE of the spherical solutes are calculated using the radial-symmetric integral equation theory. The extended version of the MA is illustrated for a protein modeled as a set of fused hard spheres immersed in a binary mixture of hard spheres. Several mixtures of different molecular-diameter ratios and compositions and 30 structures of the protein with a variety of radii of gyration are considered for the illustration purpose. The SFE calculated by the MA is compared with that by the direct application of the three-dimensional integral equation theory (3D-IET) to the protein. The deviations of the MA values from the 3D-IET values are less than 1.5\%. The computation time required is over four orders of magnitude shorter than that in the 3D-IET. The MA thus developed is expected to be best suited to analyses concerning the effects of cosolvents such as urea on the structural stability of a protein.},

We perform a systematic expansion of the profile in powers of the curvatures and apply it to a hard-sphere fluid within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT). For large distances from the wall, the curvature expansion can be done analytically. Our approach can be generalized to systems with short-ranged fluid-fluid and wall-fluid interaction potentials, as long as intrinsic length scales remain small.},

If motion invariance, continuity, and additivity of the potential are satisfied, only four morphometric measures are needed to describe fully the influence of an arbitrarily shaped container on the fluid. These three constraints can be understood as a more precise definition for the conventional term extensive and have as a consequence that the surface tension and other thermodynamic quantities contain, aside from a constant term, only contributions linear in the mean and Gaussian curvature of the container and not an infinite number of curvatures as generally assumed before. We verify this numerically in the entropic system of hard spheres bounded by a curved wall.},

The reason for this limitation is the neglect of orientational and distance correlations beyond the particle diameter. In the current article we resolve this restriction and generalize the fundamental measure theory to an expansion in intersection centers. It is shown that the intersection probability of particle systems is described by an algebra, represented by Rosenfeld's weight functions. For subdiagrams of intersection networks we derive vertex functions that provide the building blocks for the free energy functional. Their application is illustrated by deriving the Rosenfeld functional and its leading correction which is exact in the third virial order. Furthermore, the methods are used to derive an approximate functional for the infinite sum over Mayer ring diagrams. Comparing this result to the White Bear mark II functional, we find general agreement between both results.},

Beginning with a short review of the perturbation expansion of the free-energy functional, we derive two representations of the correlation functionals in rooted and unrooted Mayer diagrams, which are related by a functional derivative. This map allows to transfer the mathematical methods, developed previously for unrooted diagrams, to the current representation in rooted graphs. Translating then the Mayer to Ree-Hoover diagrams and determining their automorphism groups, yields the generic functional for all r-particle distributions. From this we derive the examples of 2- and 3-particle correlations up to four intersection centers and show that already the leading order reproduces the Wertheim, Thiele, Baxter solution for the contact probability of spheres. Another calculation shows the failure of the Kirkwood superposition approximation for any r-particle correlation.},

@article{NesicCES1991,
  abstract = {This paper presents research on evaporation of droplets containing dissolved or dispersed solids. Experiments on evaporation kinetics of droplets of water, colloidal silica, sodium sulphate and skimmed milk were performed. The experimental procedure was similar to that proposed by Charlesworth and Marshall (1960, A.I.Ch.E.J. 6, 9-23). Individual droplets were suspended in a controlled air stream and their weight and temperature were measured as evaporation progressed. Video recording of the size and appearance of the droplets was made with magnification close to 100. The temperature was followed by a micro-thermocouple, while the mass was measured by using the deflection of a calibrated glass filament balance. Experimental data were compared with a computer simulation based on a model of heat and mass transfer, both within the droplet and from the droplet surface to surrounding air. Analytical and numerical solution of the set of equations was tested. A good agreement between experimental results and the numerical predictions for a variety of evaporation regimes is reported. Diffusion coefficients for three tested materials are determined. The model includes all stages of evaporation: initial heating and evaporation, quasi-equilibrium evaporation, crust formation and growth, boiling, and porous particle drying. Stage transition criteria are defined. \textcopyright{} 1990.},

  abstract = {Free-volume theory for understanding depletion phenomena in mixtures of two species is generally derived using scaled-particle theory for those specific entities. Here we first give a general scaled-particle method for convex bodies in terms of the characteristic geometrical measures of the depletion agent, i.e., its volume, surface area, and integrated mean curvature, in mixtures with hard spheres. Second, we show that similar results can be derived from fundamental-measure theory. This different approach allows us to get a deep insight into the meaning of the various contributions to the theory from a geometrical point of view. From these two methods we arrive at a generalized "recipe" to free-volume theory. This recipe can be based on a desired equation of state for any convex shape of the depletion agents and is also valid for (polydisperse) mixtures of those. This is illustrated by mixtures of spheres with ellipsoids, spheres with several geometries as models for disklike mesogens, e.g., gibbsite, as well as depletion of spheres due to bar-shaped colloids, e.g., goethite.},

Since the computational time is drastically reduced, the new approach provides a practical and efficient way for calculating the solvation free energy which can be employed when this quantity has to be calculated for a large number of structures, as in a simulation study of protein folding.},

  abstract = {An overview of several recent developments in density functional theory for classical inhomogeneous liquids is given. We show how Levy's constrained search method can be used to derive the variational principle that underlies density functional theory. An advantage of the method is that the Helmholtz free energy as a functional of a trial one-body density is given as an explicit expression, without reference to an external potential as is the case in the standard Mermin-Evans proof by reductio ad absurdum. We show how to generalize the approach in order to express the internal energy as a functional of the one-body density distribution and of the local entropy distribution. Here the local chemical potential and the bulk temperature play the role of Lagrange multipliers in the Euler-Lagrange equations for minimiziation of the functional. As an explicit approximation for the free-energy functional for hard sphere mixtures, the diagrammatic structure of Rosenfeld's fundamental measure density unctional is laid out. Recent extensions, based on the Kierlik-Rosinberg scalar weight functions, to binary and ternary non-additive hard sphere mixtures are described.},

We conclude that although we have what we believe is a quite good understanding of homogeneous nucleation in one simple system, hard-sphere colloids, in other systems there are still basic questions that are unanswered. For example, for even the most studied protein, lysozyme, there is an ongoing debate about whether the observed nucleation is homogeneous or heterogeneous. We review theoretical and simulation work on both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation. As heterogeneous nucleation appears to be much more common than homogeneous nucleation, and as earlier reviews have tended to focus more on homogeneous nucleation, we place particular},

  abstract = {A critical review of the existing literature on the pressure exerted by growing crystals in porous materials reveals that a number of different equations are in use. A derivation of an equation for the crystallization pressure based on the chemical potentials of the loaded and the unloaded faces of a growing crystal is provided. The equation obtained is compared to other equations available in the literature and the different approaches are discussed in detail. The treatment also includes the non-ideal behavior of the liquid phase using the ion interaction approach (Pitzer equations) which is well-established in solution thermodynamics. Incorporating the ion interaction equations in the crystallization pressure equation yields a quite simple expression that appears to be more convenient than previous treatments. The equation is applied to calculate crystallization pressures for supersaturated solutions of aqueous NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4, and MgSO4 including the various hydrated forms of these salts. Depending on the nature of the salt, neglecting the non-ideal behavior may cause considerable error in crystallization pressure calculations. Finally, it is emphasized that the basic assumption of non-uniform pressure is fundamental to understand the dynamics of crystallization pressure evolving in porous materials.},

@article{Taylor2018,
  abstract = {In the Onsager model of one-component hard-particle systems, the entire phase behaviour is dictated by a function of relative orientation, which represents the amount of space excluded to one particle by another at this relative orientation. We term this function the excluded volume function. Within the context of two-dimensional convex bodies, we investigate this excluded volume function for one-component systems addressing two related questions. Firstly, given a body can we find the excluded volume function?, Secondly, can we reconstruct a body from its excluded volume function? The former is readily answered via an explicit Fourier series representation, in terms of the support function. However we show the latter question is ill-posed in the sense that solutions are not unique for a large class of bodies. This degeneracy is well characterised however, with two bodies admitting the same excluded volume function if and only if the Fourier coefficients of their support functions differ only in phase. Despite the non-uniqueness issue, we then propose and analyse a method for reconstructing a convex body given its excluded volume function, by means of a discretisation procedure where convex bodies are approximated by zonotopes with a fixed number of sides. It is shown that the algorithm will always asymptotically produce a best \$L\^2\$ approximation of the trial function, within the space of excluded volume functions of centrally symmetric bodies. In particular, if a solution exists, it can be found. Results from a numerical implementation are presented, showing that with only desktop computing power, good approximations to solutions can be readily found.},

Here, we extend the definition of PTS correlations in order to agnostically capture any type of growing order in liquids, be it local or amorphous. This advance clarifies the nature of PTS correlations, and enables the formulation of a clear distinction between slowing down due to conventional critical ordering from that due to glassiness.},

  abstract = {Sodium nitrate is a main component of aging sea salt aerosol, and its phase behavior has been studied repeatedly with wide ranges observed in the efflorescence relative humidity (RH) in particular. Studies of the efflorescence dynamics of NaNO3 droplets deposited on a ZnSe substrate are reported, using an in situ Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) technique. The time-dependence of the infrared spectra of NaNO3 aerosols accompanying step changes in RH have been measured with high signal-to-noise ratio. From the IR difference spectra recorded, changes of the time-dependent absorption peak area of the O-H stretching band ({$\nu$}-OH, {$\sim$}3400 cm(-1)) and the nitrate out-of-plane bending band ({$\nu$}2-NO3(-), {$\sim$}836 cm(-1)) are obtained. From these measurements, changes in the IR signatures can be attributed to crystalline and solution phase nitrate ions, allowing the volume fraction of the solution droplets that have crystallized to be determined. Then, using these clear signatures of the volume fraction of droplets that have yet to crystallize, the homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation kinetics can be studied from conventional measurements using a steady decline in RH. The nucleation rate measurements confirm that the rate of crystallization in sodium nitrate droplets is considerably less than in ammonium sulfate droplets at any particular degree of solute supersaturation, explaining the wide range of efflorescence RHs observed for sodium nitrate in previous studies. We demonstrate that studying nucleation kinetics using the FTIR-ATR approach has many advantages over brightfield imaging studies on smaller numbers of larger droplets or measurements made on single levitated particles.},
