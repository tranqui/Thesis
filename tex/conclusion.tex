\chapter{Conclusion}
\epigraph{We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!}{Douglas Adams, \emph{Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy}, (1979).}

To conclude...
\todo{Present morphometric approach as an alternative ensemble (semi-grand) to canonical.}
Mention self assembly: \cite{TeichNC2019}

A morphometric approach would be applicable to a general class of liquids where the soft part of the potential may be treated as a perturbation around a hard core \cite{Hansen2013}, such that a geometric decomposition still applies.
