\chapter{Applications of morphometric correlations}

\section{Locally favoured structures in hard spheres}
\subsection{Concentrations of local structure}
Fom the partition function of the potential of mean force
\subsection{Worked examples}
Where the partion function is sufficiently simple that we can perform the integral analytically
\subsubsection{$n = 2$}
The average number of neighbours (i.e. the coordination number)
\subsubsection{$n = 3$}
Average concentration of triangles
\subsection{Monte-Carlo algorithm for $n > 3$}
\subsection{$n \le 13$ results}
For selected structures we compare the concentrations of local structures from theory against molecular dynamics simulations.
This confirms that the theory accurately predicts concentrations of many-particle local structures within the hard sphere liquid.
\subsection{Density of states for all hard sphere packings $n \le 14$}
From theory, and how this is affected by changes in density

\section{Dynamical barriers along reaction paths in hard spheres}
\subsection{Free energy along a reaction path in hard spheres}
\subsubsection{Perturbation theory: alternative to harmonic approximation for hard potentials}
\subsection{Scaling of dynamical barriers with volume fraction}
\subsubsection{Worked example $n = 6$}
Simplest accessible reaction path: transition between the $n = 6$ tripyramid and octahedron.
\subsubsection{Reaction paths for $7 \le n \le 14$}

\section{Nucleation of the crystal in hard spheres}
