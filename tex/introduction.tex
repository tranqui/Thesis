\chapter{Introduction}
\epigraph{Everything starts somewhere, though many physicists disagree.}{Terry Pratchett, \emph{Hogfather}, (1996).}

What precisely is meant by soft matter, and how to properly demarcate, is a matter of some academic debate.
In introducing this area one normally takes a deep breath, and then lists all of the different systems included in this field before making general statements about what unites them.
In that vein, the soft matter label encompasses foams, gels, dispersions, liquid crystals, polymer solutions, polymer melts, granular materials, complex plasmas, active matter and many more systems of fundamental and practical importance.
The properties they share.
A more precise and scientific definition posits that the energy scale is subject to thermal fluctuations.
So e.g.\ chemical bonds break and reform allowing flow, but the physical processes may be arbitrarily more complex than simple liquids.

Confusingly, the simplest liquids%
\marginfootnote{By which we mean those formed by the noble gases at high densities.}
are often not considered a part of soft matter even though temperature is their defining energy scale.
So in some sense, soft matter can be more easily understood with \emph{vaguer} statements; as the eminent soft matter physicist Wilson Poon puts it, the essence of soft matter can be captured as ``liquids, with bits in them'' \hl{(citation?)}.
The most fundamental questions then reside at the level of liquids, regardless of whether one considers them as the antecedent to or as a subset of soft matter.

Soft matter was clearly preceded by liquids, and it is up to the individual whether liquids should be considered as the antecedent to or subsumed by soft matter.
My personal bias is that liquids represent a subset of soft matter, the zeroth order approximation to real systems.

Physics is filled with toy models.
The Ising model is the most widely studied magnetic model, and the usual starting point for students learning statistical mechanics/phase transitions particular the critical point where it is \emph{the} model system.

What are simple liquids, with hard spheres at the forefront.
\hl{Hard spheres serve as a good touchstone for some of the fundamental knowns and controversies in liquid state theory and, by extension, soft matter.}
The physicists favourite toy model is the hard sphere fluid.
Their interaction energy is simply defined by a no-overlap condition%
\marginfootnote{I like to imagine them as ideal billiard balls, without any dissipative forces so they continue to bounce off one another forever.
  And then I have a claim to being a professional pool player.},
that is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hs-interaction}
  u(r) =
  \begin{cases}
    \infty & \; r < \sigma \\
    0 & \; \textrm{otherwise},
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the diameter of the spheres.
As the potential is everywhere zero or divergent, temperature has no effect on the interactions making this system \emph{athermal}.

If crystallisation can (somehow) be circumvented, what happens to the metastable liquid branch.
For the single-component hard sphere liquid this question is of minimal practical interest, because it is nigh impossible to prevent crytallisation so this is an academic/fundamental question.

Somewhat counterintuitively, this oversimplified model has historically represented the frontiers in our understanding of real liquids.
Instead, the natural control parameter is (number) density $\rho = N/V$, or as it is normally rescaled into volume fraction: the volume of space occupied by the spheres i.e.\
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hs-volume-fraction}
  \eta
  =
  \frac{\pi \rho \sigma^3}{6}.
\end{equation}

\marginfootnote{Strictly speaking there is no distinction between the liquid and gas phase in the hard sphere model, because its phase diagram contains no critical point.
  As such, to be precise we should refer to its isotropic phase as a \emph{fluid}.
  However, we will always be focusing on the high density fluid, which serves as the starting point for descriptions of real liquids, so we can justifiably use `liquid' and `fluid' interchangeably.}

When van der Waals wrote down their famous equation of state for real gases, i.e.\
\begin{equation}
  (p - a N)(V - Nv) = N k_B T
\end{equation}
where $V - Nv$ corrects for the volume occupied by finite-sized particles and $p - aN$ for the interactions,
it was widely believed that to go beyond this to understand liquids more sophisticated treatments of the \emph{attractions} would be required.
History shows that in actual fact the treatment of \emph{repulsions} were lacking.
It turns out that to a large degree simple liquids can be considered as hard spheres plus an attractive perturbation: an accurate treatment of the repulsion is needed, attractions can be less accurate.

\begin{SCfigure}

    As macroscopic objects these balls interact as hard spheres, and they spontaneously form long-ranged orientational order seen as hexagonal domains.
    This is reminiscent of crystallisation in atomic systems.

  \label{fig:shade-balls}
\end{SCfigure}

Despite their coarse simplification of real atomic interactions, we see that hard spheres actually capture a lot of the essential physics.
To illustrate this consider the phase diagram of hard spheres Fig.\ \ref{fig:hs-phase-diagram}.
We see there is a freezing transition at $\eta = 0.494$, suggesting that the liquid will spontaneously order into a crystal at high densities.
This is surprising, in everyday scenarios (e.g.\ water) we are used to seeing crystallisation as one lowers temperature and the explanation normally given in classrooms is that the crystal is favoured due to attractions between molecules.
Now, in real systems crystallisation can also be triggered by changes to density also so density being a control parameter is not a problem, however the lack of attractions should, if this intuition were correct, prohibit crystallisation.

It turns out in the case of hard spheres that the crystal has a larger entropy above freezing, so entropy itself triggers crystallisation.
This was a hotly debated topic \cite{?,?,?} until is was solved by computer simulation in \cite{?,?,?} and experiment \cite{?,?,?}.
Part of the reason people could not believe that the crystal is entropically favoured, is because we often mistakenly take entropy to be a measure of disorder when it in fact more complicated.
The crystal might be more ordered than the liquid, with a lower \emph{configurational} entropy, however the entropy includes \emph{all} microstates not just averaged ones: the crystal is compensated by having a much larger \emph{vibrational} entropy than the liquid at high densities.
Including both these contributions leads to the phase diagram that we know today.

A similar effect is seen in balls floating on water as in e.g.\ peas in a saucepan or shade balls covering a reservoir.
The hard interactions between the balls causes%
\marginfootnote{In an attempt to find an everyday example, I have taken liberties with the interaction being purely hard; I suspect that floating balls feature effective attractions due to \emph{hydrodynamic} interactions at the water surface.}[-3cm]
them to `crystallise' at high densities as seen in Fig.\ \ref{fig:shade-balls}..
Strictly speaking these are not crystals in the sense of long-range \emph{translational} order, instead they are said to possess long-range \emph{orientational} order.
This subtlety emerges because the floating balls are confined to the water surface making them effectively two dimensional; fluctuations are strong enough in two dimensions to overcome truly long-ranged positional ordering \cite{MerminPRL1966,MerminPR1968}.

We have extolled the virtues of hard spheres, however this should not be interpretted as saying that this model system capture \emph{all} of the physics of real systems: it is a toy system after all.
They are merely a very good starting point for more complex systems.
As an example of physics they do \emph{not} capture, consider the critical point of real liquids.
Liquid-gas critical phenomena emerges from a competition between attractive and repulsive forces, with divergent fluctuations at the critical point.
It is thus impossible for a system with purely repulsive interactions, like hard spheres, to feature a critical point.
That being said, many theories predict critical phenomena quite well by taking a hard sphere potential and incorporating a mean-field like attractive perturbation \cite{?} so a hard sphere system provides a good reference point.

Hard spheres exist in more than just a theorist's imagination: they can be experimentally realised in colloidal experiments.
Colloidal suspensions are mixtures of solute immersed in a solvent composed of much smaller particles.
Colloidal particles are typically at the micron-scale.
These typically feature complex interactions \cite{Royall?,?,?} however these can be tailored to closely approximate hard sphere like interactions through steric stabilisation.
\todo{What is an aerosol? What is a dispersion?}
Colloidal experiments closely match hard simulations and theoretical predicitons \cite{?}.
Notably one can determine the phase diagram see Fig.\ \ref{fig:hs-phase-diagram}.
Note the glass at very high densities.

As the most widely studied model interaction potential we know a lot about its equilibrium structure (phase diagram) in bulk and even inhomogeneous thanks to density functional theory \cite{?,?,?}.
However, its behaviour off-equilibrium at high densities is hotly debated.
The two biggest unresolved research topics for this subject:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Nucleation}: given that above freezing the crystal ? Theoretically predicted nucleation rates from simulation studies differ by 12 orders of magnitudes from experiments, purported to be the second biggest disagreement between theory and experiment in all of science \cite{?}.
\item \emph{Metastable liquid}: if one could avoid crystallisation and equilibrate only over the liquid microstates, what would be the ultimate fate of the liquid?
  We will talk more about this in \ref{?}.
\end{itemize}

There is a deep connection between hard spheres and computer science.
Packing problems have been studied \cite{Cohn,Conway,Sloane} and they are notoriously difficult; Kepler conjectured the optimal packing in 3d was the face-centred cubic/hexagonal close packing but it took 300(?check) years to solve this.
The final proof was computer aided, and not simple.
Packing problems are connected with encoding/encryption.
Transmitting a signal requires a way to encode a message across a band(?): if packed too tightly on the band(?) then noise will destroy the signal to it is desirable to optimise the sites for bits \cite{Cohn,?,?}.
Additionally, lattice based encryption techniques are one of the alternatives to prime factorisation: the coming development of quantum computers \cite{?,?} would render prime factorisation easy because of Shor's algorithm \cite{Shor?} rendering standard encryption techniques insecure.
The techniques developed for the mean field hard sphere problem have been applied to the perceptron model \cite{?}, and deep-learning neural networks which are naturally high dimensional problems lending themselves to a mean field treatment \cite{?}.

Hard spheres will be the focus of the first 3 chapters.
Although hard spheres will be our focus, we will mention the importance of systems of hard particles of other shapes for self-assembly.
We will indicate the route to doing this throughout, and we will do this explicitly in \ref{chapter:resummation}.
Self-assembly is an active area of soft matter: it is technologically desirable to tailor the final structure by controlling the building blocks.
Imagine assembling nanomachines or artificial cells by controlling the chemistry.
It is found that varying the size and shape of hard particles can reproduce all the complexity of the periodic table \cite{Glotzer?,Dijkstra?}.
Hard spheres are the simplest such system, so a theory which can treat other geometries is desirable.

Structure of thesis.

The primary goal of this thesis is to advance the methods of treating liquids at high densities, particularly concerning the role of thermodynamics in dynamical arrest and nucleation.
The problem that we solve is quite general: given an interaction potential, what kinds of structures form in the bulk liquid.
To the best of our knowledge this problem has not been solved for an atomistic interaction potential.
Admittedly the system we choose as simple as possible while still remaining physical, but it's a start.
One can imagine this method being useful in more complex systems such as protein folding in aqueous solution, predictive self-assembly of complex structures, predictive chemical reactions etc.

A secondary goal would be to advance the understanding of the fundamental theory of hard particles in some small way.
I have attempted to develop the geometrical theory behind the methods of Chapters \ref{chapter:morphometric-framework} and \ref{chapter:morphometric-applications} in a generally applicable way.
