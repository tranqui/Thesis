In this chapter we provide a \emph{concise} account of the foundational frameworks underlying the two themes of this thesis: \emph{integral geometry} and \emph{liquid state theory}.
I expect the reader to have a background in statistical physics, so my account of liquid state theory is not intended to be exhaustive; for more in-depth treatments see the references herein.
By contrast, I do \emph{not} expect much familiarity with integral geometry.
Understanding the underlying mathematical detail is not essential to follow the rest of the thesis, so I will focus more on the key concepts and notation than detailed derivation.
I anticipate the expert reader will skim over this chapter, so I have placed the important theorems in boxes as a guide to the most relevant parts.

As many-body correlation functions are a central theme of the results chapters, I have emphasised correlation functions in section \ref{sec:liquid-structure} on liquid structure to the point where I have somewhat belaboured giving the explicit forms and normalisations of the various correlation functions.
Even though we will only use one particular hierarchy of correlation functions in the results chapters, I personally found it helpful to have these formulas in one place.
I have found myself frequently revisiting the transformations between the various hierarchies of correlation functions, so I include them in anticipation that someone repeating or extending this work can profit from having a kind of ``cheat sheet''.
