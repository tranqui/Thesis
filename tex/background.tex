\chapter{Background}
\epigraph{It tells me that the Creator used the wrong kind of circles.}{Terry Pratchett, \emph{Pyramids} (1989).}

In this chapter we provide a \emph{concise} account of the foundational frameworks underlying the two themes of this thesis: \emph{integral geometry} and \emph{liquid state theory}.
I expect the reader to have a background in statistical physics, so my account of liquid state theory is not intended to be exhaustive; for more in-depth treatments see the references therein.
By contrast, I do \emph{not} expect much familiarity with integral geometry.
Understanding the underlying mathematical detail is not essential to follow the rest of the thesis, so I will focus more on the key concepts and notation than detailed derivation.
I anticipate the expert reader will skim over this chapter, so I have placed the important theorems in boxes as a guide to the most relevant parts.
