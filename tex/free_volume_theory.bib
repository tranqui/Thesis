  abstract = {Free-volume theory for understanding depletion phenomena in mixtures of two species is generally derived using scaled-particle theory for those specific entities. Here we first give a general scaled-particle method for convex bodies in terms of the characteristic geometrical measures of the depletion agent, i.e., its volume, surface area, and integrated mean curvature, in mixtures with hard spheres. Second, we show that similar results can be derived from fundamental-measure theory. This different approach allows us to get a deep insight into the meaning of the various contributions to the theory from a geometrical point of view. From these two methods we arrive at a generalized "recipe" to free-volume theory. This recipe can be based on a desired equation of state for any convex shape of the depletion agents and is also valid for (polydisperse) mixtures of those. This is illustrated by mixtures of spheres with ellipsoids, spheres with several geometries as models for disklike mesogens, e.g., gibbsite, as well as depletion of spheres due to bar-shaped colloids, e.g., goethite.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06454},
  abstract = {In the Onsager model of one-component hard-particle systems, the entire phase behaviour is dictated by a function of relative orientation, which represents the amount of space excluded to one particle by another at this relative orientation. We term this function the excluded volume function. Within the context of two-dimensional convex bodies, we investigate this excluded volume function for one-component systems addressing two related questions. Firstly, given a body can we find the excluded volume function?, Secondly, can we reconstruct a body from its excluded volume function? The former is readily answered via an explicit Fourier series representation, in terms of the support function. However we show the latter question is ill-posed in the sense that solutions are not unique for a large class of bodies. This degeneracy is well characterised however, with two bodies admitting the same excluded volume function if and only if the Fourier coefficients of their support functions differ only in phase. Despite the non-uniqueness issue, we then propose and analyse a method for reconstructing a convex body given its excluded volume function, by means of a discretisation procedure where convex bodies are approximated by zonotopes with a fixed number of sides. It is shown that the algorithm will always asymptotically produce a best \$L\^2\$ approximation of the trial function, within the space of excluded volume functions of centrally symmetric bodies. In particular, if a solution exists, it can be found. Results from a numerical implementation are presented, showing that with only desktop computing power, good approximations to solutions can be readily found.},

  abstract = {Within scaled-particle theory, we construct an equation of state (EOS) for hard-disk mixtures by making use of an additional scaled-particle variable which weighs the densities of the different components by its radii to the power χ. This allows us to simultaneously respect exact results pertaining to the cases of a large particle or a point particle being added to the mixture. In the limit χ → 2, the mixture EOS of Santos et al. [Mol. Phys. 96, 1 (1999)] is recovered, while the limit χ → 0 yields the accurate expression for the interfacial free energy of Martin et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 149, 084701 (2018)]. From the low-density limit of the EOS, the value χ ≈ 0.8 is extracted, which is shown to yield a mixture EOS that is signiﬁcantly more accurate than the expressions due to Santos et al. and Martin et al. In particular, the systematic deviation inherent to these prior results is remedied.},
